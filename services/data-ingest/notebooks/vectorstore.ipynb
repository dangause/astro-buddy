The current highest redshift quasar host\\ndetected3, atz=4.5, required the magnifying effect of a foreground lensing galaxy. Low-luminosity\\nquasars4,5,6from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)7mitigate the\\nchallenge of detecting their underlying, previously-undetected host galaxies. Here we report rest-\\nframe optical images and spectroscopy of two HSC-SSP quasars at z>6with JWST . Using NIRCam\\nimaging at 3.6 µm and 1.5 µm and subtracting the light from the unresolved quasars, we find that\\nthe host galaxies are massive (stellar masses of 13×and3.4×1010M⊙, respectively), compact, and\\ndisk-like. NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy shows stellar absorption lines in the more\\nmassive quasar, confirming the detection of the host. Velocity-broadened gas in the vicinity of these\\nquasars enables measurements of their black hole masses ( 1.4×109and2.0×108M⊙, respectively).\\nTheir location in the black hole mass - stellar mass plane is consistent with the distribution at low\\nredshift, suggesting that the relation between black holes and their host galaxies was already in\\nplace less than a billion years after the Big Bang.\\nThe quasars J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 (coordinates listed in Extended Data Table 1) are at redshifts\\nof6.40and6.34.

We perform a two-component\\nmodel fit of the rest-frame optical emission in a region of the NIRCam images centered on each target.\\nWe use the software galight12to identify stars from each image to model the two-dimensional (2D)\\npoint-spread function (PSF). We then model each quasar image in each filter as a sum of a point-like quasar\\nand an extended host. The host galaxy was modeled using a 2D Sérsic profile13whose parameters include\\nthe position, size (R eff), axis ratio, orientation, flux, and the radial profile/shape of the light distribution\\n(i.e., Sérsic index), allowing a flexible description of the a priori unknown host galaxy shape. In Extended\\nData Table 1, we report the best-fit parameters and their uncertainties based on the dispersion resulting\\nfrom different PSF models with different modeling techniques (see Methods).\\nAs shown in Figure 2, we detect the host galaxies for both targets, which are visible after subtracting\\nthe quasar point-source model (third column). For J2236+0032, the quasar host is significantly detected\\nin both filters ( mF356W =23.12±0.20mag; mF150W =25.12±0.29mag). The inferred host-to-total flux\\nratios are 25.5±4.4%, and 10.2±2.8%with sizes (R eff) of0.7±0.1kpc and 0.5±0.2kpc for F356W\\nand F150W, respectively. The light distribution is elongated in the same direction (i.e., NE–SW) in the\\ntwo filters, suggesting a mildly inclined disk-like host. For this target, we fix the Sérsic index to 1in both\\nbands – corresponding to an exponential disk model – to avoid non-physical fits; this is supported by a\\nsubsequent fit to the host galaxy emission after subtracting the quasar (see Methods). For J2255+0251,\\nthe host galaxy is clearly detected in the F356W band ( mF356W =24.58±0.30mag) with a host-to-total\\nflux ratio of 9.8±2.6%. The host emission extends southeast (left) of the quasar’s location. The size of\\nthe host is inferred to be R eff=1.5±1.1kpc with a Sérsic index of 1.5±1.4, suggesting a more disk-like\\nthan spheroidal profile. The host galaxy is not detected in the F150W image, resulting in an upper limit\\nofmF150W=26.3mag (see Methods). This upper limit provides an important constraint on the galaxy\\nspectral energy distribution (SED). A non-detection is not surprising, given the low host-to-total flux ratio\\nin the F356W band and the fact that galaxies are typically fainter blueward of the 4000 Å break. We\\nuse NIRSpec14observations to demonstrate that the contribution of extended line emission to the host\\nphotometry in F356W is minimal (See Methods).\\nOur two photometric bands lie on either side of the 4000 Å break, allowing us to quantify the\\ncontributions of young and relatively old stars, and thus to estimate the stellar masses of the two quasar\\nhost galaxies.

The sizes of our host galaxies are defined using the Sérsic effective\\nradius R effalong the semi-major axis measured by galight .\\nThe quasar host of J2236+0032 appears to be a compact galaxy. As a result, we find that the Sérsic n\\nis poorly constrained, and the resulting host residual is point-like with an inferred R effof0.′′03(the lower\\nlimit of the prior), indicating that the central PSF has not been fully removed.

To check whether the apparent host is\\ncaused by a random ghost from any particular dither frame, we reanalyze the data using the first 8 and the\\nsecond 8 dithers separately. We are able to detect the host from both halves of the data. To ensure that the\\napparent host galaxy flux is not dominated by a mismatched PSF core, we mask the quasar center (using a\\n0.′′12and0.′′06radius aperture for F356W and F150W, respectively) and redo the fit. Again, the host is\\nwell-detected.\\nTo rule out the possibility that the residual emission (host galaxy) is an artifact of the chosen PSF stars,\\nwe selected the five top-performing PSF in the library, and identified twenty pairs from these. We then fit\\none PSF with the other without assuming any host component for all pairs. We performed this test for stars\\nin the fields of J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 in both bands; residual images show no extended features\\nin any case. This is illustrated for J2255+0251 in the F356W filter in the top panels of Extended Data\\nFigure 3. We also fit galaxy + host models to pure PSF images, in which case the inferred host magnitudes\\nwere roughly two magnitudes fainter than the hosts detected around the quasars. In contrast, we clearly\\ndetect the quasar host when we use any of the five library PSFs and, using these stellar residual maps to\\nmeasure the standard deviation, we display the maps of the host signal-to-noise ratio for all images of our\\ntwo quasars in the bottom panels of Extended Data Figure 3.\\nWe carried out three sets of simulations to further validate our host detections, including J2255+0251\\nin the F356W filter and J2236+0032 in the F356W and F150W filters. In one realization of the simulation,\\nwe randomly select a PSF from the five top-ranked PSFs in the library, and add a Sérsic profile using the\\nbest-fit parameters from our model inference. We sample the resulting mock quasar +host image at the\\nobserved resolution and insert it into a random empty position in the JWST NIRCam data. We then model\\nthe images with the other four PSF stars, and select the result with the best performance. We repeated this\\nsimulation a hundred times to quantify the bias and standard deviation of the inferred values around the\\ntrue values. We found that the key Sérsic parameters can be obtained accurately, with biases well below\\n1σin all quantities.

The similar scatter distribution\\ncan be found when setting this parameter to 2.\\nFinally, we tested the fidelity of the host magnitude inference using a joint fit across the two bands. We\\nfix the host galaxy parameters for J2236+0032 (where the host is detected in F150W), setting the Sérsic\\nparameters to those inferred from F356W; we find a very similar host magnitude to the value when all\\nparameters are allowed to vary: the changes in the inferred host magnitude are within 0.1 mag.\\nStellar mass of the host galaxy\\nWe use SED fitting to estimate the stellar masses of our two host galaxies at z∼6.4using the photometry\\nand its uncertainty based on NIRCam imaging with two filters (F356W and F150W) which straddle the\\nrest-frame 4000 Å break. The host galaxy of J2255+0251 is not detected in the F150W filter, thus we\\ntake 26.3mag as a lower limit on the magnitude. We adopt a Chabrier IMF in our analysis to allow direct\\ncomparison with the local black hole - host galaxy mass relations (e.g., ref. 21,22). Contributions of\\nnebular emission lines from the host galaxies are also allowed with a uniform log ionization parameter\\nlogUover the range [−3,−1]. Three key parameters define the shape of the SED template: age, metallicity,\\nand dust attenuation (A v). We adopt a uniform prior on the age over the range [0.01, 0.84] (in Gyr),\\nextending to the age of the universe at z=6.4. We adopt a uniform prior in metallicity logZ/Z⊙over\\nthe range [−1,−0.3]following ref. 36,37. We assume an A vrange of [0, 5.0] mag for both targets. For\\nJ2255+0251, the F150W band has an upper limit on the flux thus the constraint on A vis weaker; hence,\\nwe assume A vfollows a log-normal distribution with a median value at 0.85 as supported by recent JWST\\nobservations of high-redshift galaxies38. A measurement of the Balmer decrement (i.e., the ratio of narrow\\nHαand H βin the spectrum) implies an attenuation A v=0.67±0.13 mag for the narrow-line region (Onoue\\net al., in prep), consistent with the median extinction value of our prior. We also note that for J2236+0032,\\nthe contribution of the host in the spectrum (Onoue et al., in prep) has a magnitude in close agreement\\nwith the NIRCam photometry, supporting our stellar mass estimate.\\nWe use gsf39to perform the SED model fitting. This software generates a set of templates with\\na range of ages and metallicities according to the prior to fit a composite stellar population (CSP)-like\\nstar formation history. A random parameter sampling is performed through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo\\n(MCMC) to infer the probability distribution of the SED parameters. For J2236+0032 and J2255+0251,\\nthe inferred values of log M ∗are11.12+0.40\\n−0.27and10.53+0.51\\n−0.37(in units of M⊙), respectively, as shown in\\nExtended Data Table 1. In Extended Data Figure 5, we present the best-fit SEDs of the two quasar hosts,\\nin which the MCMC inference indicates that the stellar mass is mildly sensitive to age and metallicity but\\nis more sensitive to A v. We also adopt the same configuration for the independent code Bagpipes40\\nandCIGALE41to perform SED fits; we find values of M ∗that change by 0.1 dex or less. The robust\\nmeasurement of stellar mass is due to having photometry on both sides of the 4000 Å break, accurate\\nspectroscopic redshifts, and a firm upper limit of the stellar age 0.84 Gyr, given the age of the universe at\\nz=6.4. Even so, we note that additional systematic uncertainties may be unaccounted for thus leading to\\ngreater uncertainty in the mass estimates than we have quoted.\\nNIRSpec Observations and data reduction\\nThe NIRSpec Fixed-Slit data for the two quasars were obtained on October 30, 2022 for J2236+0032 and\\nOctober 28, 2022 for J2255+0251.

Assuming that the broad H βemission traces the kinematics of the gas orbiting\\nin the vicinity of the SMBHs (the so-called broad-line-region), one can use the line width of H βas a proxy\\nof the rotation velocity of the broad-line-region gas. There is also an empirical correlation between the\\nrest-frame 5100 Å continuum luminosity ( L5100) and the radius from the SMBH to the broad-line-region\\ngas, which is observed by the reverberation mapping technique44. In this paper, we use the recipe provided\\nby ref. 16 to estimate the black hole mass:\\nMBH=106.91\\x12L5100\\n1044erg s−1\\x130.50\\x12FWHM Hβ\\n103km s−1\\x132\\nM⊙.

We report the derived BH properties in Extended Data Table 2.\\nWe estimate the host galaxy contribution to the rest-optical continua of the NIRSpec spectra, using the\\ndecomposed host galaxy images in the NIRCam’s F356W filter. Referring to the relative position angle\\nof the NIRCam and NIRSpec observations, we find that the stellar emission falling inside the 0.′′2×0.′′6\\nextraction aperture is 21.8% (J2236+0032) and 4.8% (J2255+0251) with respect to the total emission.\\nWe interpret this as the fraction of the host starlight in the observed continuum emission in the NIRSpec\\nG395M spectrum for each source, which allows us to correct the 5100 Å continuum luminosity to that from\\nthe quasar emission alone. Accordingly, the virial BH masses become M BH= (1.36±0.15)×109M⊙\\nfor J2236+0032 and M BH= (1.97±0.17)×108M⊙for J2255+0251, respectively. These corrected BH\\nproperties are reported in Extended Data Table 2, and are adopted in Figure 4. This correction is more\\nsignificant for J2236+0032, in which stellar absorption lines are detected (Figure 3).\\nEmission from H β+[O III] in the hosts\\nOur SED model allows for the inclusion of the H β+[O III] line emission that falls within the F365W filter\\n(Extended Data Figure 5). However, if those lines were of high equivalent width in the hosts, they could\\naffect the broad-band photometry used in the stellar mass inference, especially if the gas is ionized by\\nthe quasar45,46. To ensure that our NIRCam detection of extended host emission is not dominated by\\nthese lines, we directly compare the total flux of the H β+[O III] narrow lines seen in our spectra with the\\ncontribution from the host in the NIRCam image within the aperture of the spectral slit. For J2236+0032,\\nnarrow H βemission is not detected and the [O III] emission in NIRSpec contributes only ∼3%of the\\nhost galaxy light.\\nFor J2255+0251, the narrow H β+[O III] emission is comparable to the host galaxy brightness measured\\nin the F356W filter. Much of this emission may be coming from the narrow-line region of the quasar itself.\\nTo quantify the impact on the detection of the stellar continuum, we use the 2D NIRSpec spectroscopic\\ndata and fit a Gaussian to the unresolved spatial profile at each wavelength, allowing the centroid to\\nvary linearly with wavelength, setting the width to be the same as the spatial PSF as measured from a\\npublicly available reference star in the same spectroscopic configuration as our observations, and letting\\nthe amplitude be a free parameter. The best-fit Gaussian profile at each wavelength is then subtracted\\nfrom the 2D spectrogram to reveal any spatially extended [O III] emission in the spectrum. A background\\nregion of equivalent size is subtracted from the extended emission region. We calculate the flux density of\\nthe extended emission in the F356W band and compare it to the flux density of the NIRCam host galaxy\\nwithin the aperture of the NIRSpec slit on the sky. For J2255+0251, the [O III] extended emission has a\\nmagnitude of 27.6, which is 11% of the flux of the observed host galaxy within the slit aperture. Note that\\nthe measurement of the extended emission is based on the observational fact that the apparent minor axis\\nof J2255+0251 is wider than the scale of the PSF in F356W (see Figure 2). We thus conclude that the\\nmajority of the narrow H β+[O III] emission in J2255+0251 comes from the unresolved quasar, which has\\nbeen removed by our quasar decomposition. For J2236+0032, we use the same approach and find that the\\nextended [O III] has a magnitude of 27.5 mag. The flux ratio between the extended [O III] and the host\\ngalaxy within the slit is ∼3%.

Introduction\\nQuasars, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in general, are powered by accretion onto the\\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of their host galaxies. Quasars are the most\\nluminous non-transient sources in the Universe, and have been observed up to a redshift\\nofz∼7.6 (Wang et al. 2021b). SMBH activities are a key ingredient of galaxy formation.\\nQuasars provide crucial probes of galaxy evolution and cosmology across cosmic history at\\nthree critical spatial scales:\\n1. At the scale of the AGN central engine ( <1pc), quasar emission originates from well\\nwithin the SMBH sphere of inﬂuence, at which the gravitational inﬂuence of the BH\\ndominates. Quasars are fundamental in understanding the physics of BH accretion\\nand growth and the physics of AGN activity.\\n2. At the scale of quasar host galaxies ( ∼1−10 kpc), the evolution of quasars and\\ngalaxies are strongly coupled, as shown by the tight correlation between SMBH mass', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

At the scale of galaxy clusters and superclusters ( >Mpc), quasars can be used to\\nprobe the growth of early large scale structure. They also provide sightlines to study\\nthe properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM), including the history of cosmic\\nreionization, the chemical enrichment of the IGM, the distribution of baryons and\\nthe evolution of ionization state of the IGM, and its connection to galaxy formation\\nthrough the circumgalactic medium (CGM).\\nThe history of quasar studies is driven and shaped by innovations in systematic surveys\\nand multiwavelength observations of quasars. These observations aim to reaching higher\\nredshift, covering the full range of quasar luminosities, and spatially resolving quasar hosts\\nand their central AGN structure. Studies of high-redshift quasars within the ﬁrst few billion\\nyears of cosmic history started with the advent of large area digital or digitized sky surveys,\\nhighlighted by progress made using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York\\net al. 2000), which resulted in the ﬁrst detections of quasars at z>5 andz>6 (Fan et al.\\n2001). Observations of z∼6 quasars in the early 2000s provided fundamental insights in\\nthe three key scales of galaxy evolution mentioned above:\\n1. SMBHs with masses up to a few billion M⊙already existed in the Universe within\\none billion years after the Big Bang, requiring a combination of early massive BH\\nseeds and rapid BH accretion.\\n2. Early luminous quasars are sites of intensive galaxy-scale star formation and the\\nassembly of early massive galaxies.\\n3. Detection of strong IGM absorption in quasar spectra, especially the emergence of\\ncomplete Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs (Gunn & Peterson 1965) shows a rapid\\ntransition of the ionization state of the IGM at z∼5−6, marking this epoch as the\\nend of cosmic reionization.\\nIn this review, we will focus on the progress since then, including the quests for the\\nearliest quasars, and the detailed studies of quasars during and right after the epoch of\\nreionization (EoR). We will limit our discussions to: (1) the redshift range of z > 5.3;\\nthis is the lower redshift limit at which there are still detectable signatures of reionization\\nactivity. This redshift corresponds to 1.1 Gyr after the Big Bang, when the Universe was at\\n8% of its current age. We consider z>5.3 as “cosmic dawn” in the context of this review.\\n(2) Luminous Type-1 quasars, for which secure spectroscopic observations and systematic\\nsurveys are currently possible. (3) IGM studies using quasar absorption spectra; we will\\nnot discuss other probes of EoR in detail. This review will focus mainly on observations,\\nand we will discuss theories and simulations largely in the context of understanding and\\npredicting observations.\\nAt the time of this review, JWST has started routine observations, and initial JWST\\nresults have begun to appear in the literature. We will not include any early JWST results\\nin this article. JWST observations of high-redshift quasars will undoubtedly provide many\\nnew insights that will result in discoveries and challenges that should be the subject of a\\nfuture review.\\nThere have been a number of excellent Annual Review articles on related topics which\\nwe will not repeat: Inayoshi et al. (2020) reviewed topics related to the initial BH seeds and\\nearly growth; Kormendy & Ho (2013) presented a very detailed discussion of BH/galaxy co-\\nevolution; Carilli & Walter (2013) reviewed early (pre-ALMA) sub/mm observations of high-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 3', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

In this Section, we will present a database of all published\\nType-1 quasars at z > 5.3. In Section 3, we will discuss the evolution of quasars as a\\npopulation at high redshift, and present the measurements of quasar luminosity function,\\nand the trend in the evolution of quasar intrinsic properties in early epochs. We will also\\nhighlight special populations of high-redshift quasars. In Section 4, we will discuss the use\\nof high-redshift quasars as probes to the history of SMBH growth in the early Universe,\\nand review statistics of measurements of quasar BH masses and accretion characteristics.\\nIn Section 5, we will review the observations of quasar host galaxies from the rest-frame UV\\nto far-IR, in the context of the co-evolution of early SMBH growth and galaxy formation,\\nand the roles quasar played in early galaxy and structure formation. In Section 6, we\\nwill review the the progress in using IGM absorption in quasar sight lines and properties\\nof quasar proximity zones to probe the history of cosmic reionization and IGM chemical\\nenrichment.

THE QUASAR REDSHIFT FRONTIER\\nAdvances in the studies of high-redshift quasars are ﬁrst and foremost driven by advances in\\nhigh-redshift quasar surveys and new discoveries. The quasar redshift frontier continues to\\nexpand as a result of new sky surveys: the ﬁrst quasar discoveries at z>4 in the 1980s were\\nmade possible by digital or digitized large sky surveys and the ﬁrst implementations of color\\ndrop-out selection techniques (e.g., Warren et al. 1987). After the SDSS discoveries of the\\nﬁrstz>5 (Fan et al. 1999) and z>6 (Fan et al. 2001) quasars in the early 2000s, wide-ﬁeld\\nnear-infrared (NIR) sky surveys in the following decade, such as UKIDSS (Lawrence et al.\\n2007) led to the detection of the ﬁrst quasars at z >7 (e.g., Mortlock et al. 2011), deep\\ninto the EoR. At the time of this review, the quasar redshift frontier stands at z= 7.64\\n(Wang et al. 2021b). Meanwhile, increasingly large samples of high-redshift quasars are\\nestablished by continued mining and systematic spectroscopic followup observations based\\non these new surveys. Currently, about 1000 quasars have been discovered at z >5, and\\nmore than 200 at z>6.\\n2.1. Progress in High-Redshift Quasar Surveys\\nSurveys of the highest redshift quasars face three technical challenges. First, quasars at\\ncosmic dawn are among the rarest objects in the Universe. The ﬁnal SDSS z∼6 quasar\\nsample covers more than 11,000 deg2, but contains only 52 quasars (Jiang et al. 2016).\\nTheir discoveries require large surveys that cover a signiﬁcant fraction of the sky. The\\nsecond challenge is often referred to as “ﬁnding needles in a haystack”. Most high-redshift\\nquasar surveys are based on Lyman break dropout selections using optical and NIR pho-\\ntometric survey data. However, other populations of celestial objects, in particular cool\\ngalactic dwarfs with spectral types M, L and T (usually referred as MLTs) and compact\\n4 Fan et al.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='early-type intermediate-redshift galaxies, have similar optical and NIR colors. Barnett et al.\\n(2019) show that these contaminant populations outnumber z∼7 quasars by 2–4 orders of\\nmagnitude in deep photometric surveys. A number of photometric selection techniques have\\nbeen developed, and the choices of how to apply these techniques require careful consider-\\nation of the balance between selection eﬃciency and completeness. Finally, spectroscopic\\nidentiﬁcations of candidate quasars require observations on large aperture telescopes. Until\\nrecently, such observations were only possible with single-object spectroscopy because the\\nlow spatial density of high-redshift quasars. The demand of telescope resources for discovery\\ndrives the need for both high selection eﬃciency and sometimes special observing strategies.\\nFor example, Wang et al. (2017) improved spectroscopic identiﬁcation eﬃciency by using\\nlow-resolution ( R∼300) long-slit NIR spectroscopy, which could capture the prominent\\nLyman break features in the quasar spectra and reject contaminants with shorter exposure\\nthan higher resolution spectra, which is more common for quasar spectroscopy followup\\nwork, would require.\\n5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5\\nRedshift−28\\n−26\\n−24\\n−22\\n−20M1450(UV magnitude)\\n2019≤year≤2022\\n2016≤year<2019\\n2000≤year<2016\\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2020\\nYear0200400600z≥5.3 quasarsTotal = 531\\nFigure 1\\nDistribution of all known z≥5.3 quasars in the absolute magnitude-redshift plane (top panel).\\nThe shaded areas are the parameter space probed by selected large quasar survey programs.

Optimization of Photometric Selection of High-Redshift Quasars\\nThe vast majority of high-redshift quasars have been discovered using color selection. The\\nmost commonly used method is to implement a series of “color cuts”: select objects that\\nmeet a set of criteria in the ﬂux/ﬂux-error space (usually referred to as the “color space”) as\\nhigh-redshift quasar candidates. These cuts are often initially guided by a combination of\\nphotometry of existing high-redshift quasars and simulated colors based on synthetic quasar\\nspectra, as well as observed and simulated data of the contaminant populations. These cuts\\nare reﬁned as surveys progress with larger training sets and better understanding of the\\ncontaminant populations. Fan (1999) presented an early example of color space simulation\\nof diﬀerent populations of objects with compact morphology (quasars, normal stars, white\\ndwarfs and compact galaxies) in the SDSS photometric system. This simulation was used\\nto formulate color selections for both the SDSS main spectroscopic survey (Richards et al.\\n2002) and selections of z∼6 quasars (Fan et al. 2001). Works such as Hewett et al. (2006),\\nMcGreer et al. (2013), Barnett et al. (2019), and Temple et al. (2021) expanded these\\nsimulations by including more realistic quasar population models and models of MLT and\\nintermediate-redshift galaxies, extending to higher redshifts, and including NIR and MIR\\nphotometric bands.\\nHigh-redshift surveys based on SDSS (e.g., Jiang et al. 2016), PS1 (e.g., Ba˜ nados et al.\\n2016) as well as works using the DESI Legacy Survey (e.g., Wang et al. 2019) used color\\ncuts as their primary selection method. The color cut method is simple to implement, and\\nhas high selection completeness even for objects that have unusual spectral features such\\nas broad absorption lines (BALs), weak emission lines or those with modest reddening,\\nbecause the color cuts are usually fairly loose and cover a large portion of color space, and\\nthe strong Lyman break is not strongly aﬀected by the intrinsic quasar SEDs. On the\\nother hand, because all candidates that satisfy the cuts are selected without considering\\nthe relative density distribution of the targeted (quasar) population and the contaminant\\npopulations (primary MLTs and compact galaxies), or how the candidate SEDs match the\\nquasar template, color cut selection tends to have a higher contamination rate. For example,\\nWang et al. (2019) ﬁnd a 30% spectroscopic success rate when searching for z>6.5 quasars.\\nThe contamination grows signiﬁcantly worse for z∼7.5 (F. Wang, private communication).\\nA number of techniques have been applied to improve the eﬃciency of color selection.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 7', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='These improvements are especially important for quasars at the highest redshift ( z>6.5),\\nwhere quasars are increasingly rare compared to the contaminant populations, and at fainter\\nﬂuxes for which increasing photometric errors results in more contaminants scatter into the\\nselected area in color space. Mortlock et al. (2012) ﬁrst introduced a selection algorithm\\nbased on Bayesian model comparison (BMC). In BMC, the posterior quasar probability for\\na given object with survey photometry dis given by :\\nPq=p(q|d) =Wq(d)\\nWq(d) +Wb(d) +Wg(d), 1.\\nwhere q, b, and g represent quasar, brown dwarf (MLTs), and galaxy populations, re-\\nspectively.

BMC wss applied by Mortlock et al. (2011) to data from the\\nUKIDSS survey to identify the ﬁrst quasar at z>7. The SHELLQs survey (Matsuoka et al.\\n2022) used BMC to select faint quasars in the HSC survey with great success in achieving\\na high spectroscopic identiﬁcation rate ( ∼75%) even at the low-luminosity end at z∼6.\\nWagenveld et al.

(2021) presented a detailed comparison study of diﬀerent selection tech-\\nniques in searching for z >6.5 quasars using VIKING survey data. They show that BMC\\nis highly complete in recovering previously known quasars in the survey area, and at the\\nsame time eﬀectively rejects conﬁrmed contaminants. Using simulations, they calculate the\\nsurvey selection function – completeness as a function of quasar redshift and luminosity, and\\nﬁnd that both BMC and the SED method represent a signiﬁcant improvement in selection\\ncompleteness and depth compared to simple color cuts.\\nWenzl et al. (2021) used a random forest supervised machine learning method to select\\nz>5 quasars from PS1 data with high eﬃciency. Nanni et al. (2022) proposed an alternative\\nprobabilistic approach, in which the density of the contaminant populations in color space\\nis modeled as Gaussian mixtures based on observed photometric data and calculated using\\nthe extreme deconvolution technique, instead of using simulated population models.\\nHigh-redshift quasar selection can also be considered in the context of supervised ma-\\nchine learning. The training sets of existing objects are small, and in most case are subject\\nto the bias of previously selected samples or extrapolations from low-redshift populations.\\nThe choice of high-redshift quasar selection algorithm in a given survey is a tradeoﬀ be-\\ntween completeness and eﬃciency. Selections that rely on SED and contaminant population\\nmodels run the risk of missing objects that are highly valuable but have unusual properties.\\nAn example is the discovery of J0100+2802, the most luminous unlensed quasar currently\\nknown atz >5 (Wu et al. 2015). The object was assigned as low priority in the original\\nSDSS survey due to its relatively red color and bright apparently magnitude, indicating\\nhigh probability of it being a brown dwarf.

The\\nSDSS main quasar survey (Richards et al. 2002) targeted quasars up to z∼5.4. The Dark\\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI, Abareshi et al. 2022) is using spectrographs with\\n5000 ﬁbers on the 4-m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak to conduct a 5-year spectroscopic\\nsurvey of∼40 million galaxies, quasars and stars. DESI is expected to more than double\\nthe number of quasars known at z>5 when completed. A similar survey is being planned\\nfor the 4MOST project (Merloni 2019).\\nOther established quasar selection methods include variability, astrometry (i.e., lack of\\nproper motion; Lang et al. 2009), detections in X-ray and radio wavelengths, MIR colors,\\nas well as wide-ﬁeld slitless spectroscopy. Except for the last method (e.g., Schneider et al.\\n1989, 1999), most selection methods are not sensitive to the quasar redshifts.

Future Quasar Surveys\\nNew surveys are on the horizon to further expand the quasar redshift frontier. The Legacy\\nSurvey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will cover the southern\\nsky at optical wavelengths to unprecedented depths. LSST will reach 5 σco-added depths in\\nthezandybands at 25−26 mag level in 5-10 years (Ivezi´ c et al. 2019), allowing selections of\\nseveral thousand quasars and AGN at z∼6−7.5 using both color and variablity selection\\nmethods, while providing deep photometry in the dropout bands for selection of z > 7\\nquasars. ESA’s Euclid mission will provide deep near-IR photometry not possible with\\nground-based observations. It will cover 15,000 deg2of the sky to a 5 σdepth of 24 mag in\\nY, J and H bands (Scaramella et al. 2022), enabling selection of quasar candidates up to\\nz∼10. Barnett et al. (2019) predicted that Euclid + LSST will allow discoveries of ∼25\\nquasars atz>7.5, including∼8 beyondz>8, although the exact yields strongly depend\\non the assumed evolution of quasar luminosity function. Further in the future is NASA’s\\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will cover a smaller area in its High Latitude\\nSurvey but reaching about two magnitude deeper.\\nFan et al. (2019a) show that by extrapolating the current measurement of the quasar\\nluminosity function, there will be only one “SDSS”-like quasar ( M1450<−26, powered by\\nbillion-M⊙SMBH) over the entire observable universe at z>9. The combination of LSST,\\nEuclid and Roman will allow the discovery of the earliest luminous quasars in the Universe.\\nHowever, in addition to the challenges of their selection (Barnett et al. 2019, Nanni et al.\\n2022), their spectroscopic identiﬁcation will require IR spectrographs more powerful than\\nthose with the current ground-based telescopes: 30m-class extremely large telescopes and\\nJWST will be the primary tools for their conﬁrmation and follow-up observations.\\n3. AN EVOLVING QUASAR POPULATION\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst review the evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at high\\nredshift, which directly constrains the growth history of early SMBHs (Sec 3.1). The number\\ndensity of quasars is found to decline rapidly towards high redshift, in sharp constrast to\\nthe lack of strong evolution in the SEDs of quasars (Sec 3.2), from X-ray to radio, and in\\nparticular in the rest-frame UV to NIR, at which the quasar SED peaks, although a number\\nof sub-types of quasars appear to be more common at z>5−6.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 11', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

Evolution of Quasar Luminosity Function\\nSoon after the initial discovery of quasars, Schmidt (1968) found that their density rises\\nsharply with redshift up to z≳2. Wide-ﬁeld surveys such as 2dF (Boyle et al. 2000) and\\nSDSS (Richards et al. 2006b) established that the density of luminous quasars peaks at\\nz∼2−3. Osmer (1982) presented the ﬁrst evidence that quasar density at z>3.5 appears\\nto be declining. Schmidt et al. (1995) characterized this decline as an exponential function\\nwith redshift:\\nρ(z)∝10kz, 2.\\nwherekis measured to be ∼−0.5 atz∼3−5. The shape of the QLF is usually described\\nas a double, or broken, power law:\\nΦ(M1450,z) =Φ∗(z)\\n100.4(α+1)(M1450−M∗\\n1450)+ 100.4(β+1)(M1450−M∗\\n1450)3.\\nwhereM1450is the absolute magnitude of the quasar continuum at rest-frame 1450 ˚A,αand\\nβare the faint-end and bright-end slopes, respectively, M∗\\n1450is the characteristic absolute\\nmagnitude or break magnitude measured at 1450 ˚A, and Φ∗is the normalization of the LF\\nwhich has an exponential decline described in Eq. 2.\\nEarly high-redshift surveys such as the SDSS were only sensitive to the most luminous\\nquasars. Based on a sample of nine SDSS quasars at z >5.7, Fan et al. (2004) found that\\natz∼6, the co-moving spatial density of quasars with M1450<−26.7 is 6×10−10Mpc−3,\\nconsistent with extrapolation from lower redshift trends. Jiang et al. (2009) extended the\\nSDSS quasar survey to the “stripe 82” region, reaching two magnitudes deeper than the\\nSDSS main survey. They found a bright end slope βbetween –2.6 and –3.1. Willott et al.\\n(2010) combined the faint quasars discovered in the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey\\n(CFHQS) with the brighter SDSS quasars, and presented the ﬁrst measurement of QLF at\\nz∼6 using a sample of 40 quasars. They found a bright end slope β=−2.81 and a break\\nmagnitude M∗\\n1450=−25.1; the faint end slope was still poorly constrained at this redshift.\\nJiang et al.

In addition, they found a density evolution with the exponential evolution\\nparameter k=−0.72±0.11, a signiﬁcantly steeper slope than the value at z∼3−5,\\nsuggesting an accelerated evolution of luminous quasars between z∼5 and 6.\\nThe SHELLQs project (Matsuoka et al. 2016) extended the z∼6 quasar sample to\\nsigniﬁcantly lower luminosity.

Their measured QLF showed a strong break and a signiﬁcant ﬂattening at\\nthe faint end at z∼6. Schindler et al. (2022) used the combination of the bright PS1\\nquasar sample that includes 125 quasars at z∼5.7−6.2 with the fainter quasars from\\nSHELLQs for a new QLF measurement at z∼6. They found a steeper bright-end slope\\nofβ=−3.84+0.63\\n−1.21, as well as a steeper faint-end slope of α=−1.70+0.29\\n−0.19, with a bright\\nbreak magnitude of M∗\\n1450=−26.38+0.79\\n−0.60.

(A Lack of) Evolution of the Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions\\nHigh-redshift galaxies have intrinsic blue SEDs that are dominated by young stellar popu-\\nlations. Metallicity, or chemical abundance, in their ISM has also been shown to be lower\\nthan in low-redshift galaxies (Stark 2016). However, the overall SEDs and the chemical\\nabundance in quasar broad line regions (BLRs) do not evolve signiﬁcantly with redshift, al-\\nthough quasar density decreases drastically at high-redshift. This apparent lack of spectral\\nevolution in the UV properties of quasars were noticed as soon as the ﬁrst z∼6 quasars\\nwere discovered (e.g., Barth et al. 2003, Fan et al. 2004, Iwamuro et al. 2004, Jiang et al.\\n2007). Shen et al. (2019) conducted an optical/NIR spectroscopic survey of 50 quasars at\\nz >5.7. Their observations covered the wavelength range from the Ly αto Mg iiemission\\nlines. Yang et al. (2021) presented a spectroscopic survey of 34 quasars at 6 .3< z < 7.6,\\ncovering a similar wavelength range. Both papers presented composite rest-frame UV spec-\\ntra of their high-redshift samples. Fig 5 compares the quasar composite spectra at z∼6−7\\nwith the standard low-redshift SDSS quasar composite from Vanden Berk et al. (2001). The\\naverage continuum slope and emission line strength/width do not evolve signiﬁcantly with\\nredshift, with the exception of a weaker and blueshifted C ivemission line (see discussion\\nin Sec 5.4).\\nBroad emission line ratios in quasars have been used to constrain metallicities in the\\nquasar BLR. Jiang et al. (2007) and De Rosa et al.

Schindler et al. (2020) carried out detailed modeling of Fe iiand\\nMgiilines using a large sample of quasar spectra from VLT/Xshooter, and compared their\\nmeasurements with those in the literature. There is no evidence of evolution in the Fe/Mg\\nratio up to the highest redshift, although scatter is large at any given redshift (Fig 5). The\\nlack of spectral evolution in quasar rest-frame UV spectra, especially in the emission line\\nproperties, indicates that quasar BLRs are chemically enriched very rapidly, within the ﬁrst\\nfew hundred million years after the initial star formation in the host galaxy. This is not\\nsurprising, as we will review in Sec 5: quasar host galaxies are sites of the most intense star\\nformation in the early universe.\\nHowever, there are a few noticeable evolutionary trends in quasars at cosmic dawn that\\ncould be related to the early phase of quasar growth. In Sec 5.4, we discuss an increasing\\nfraction of quasars with strongly blue-shifted high ionization UV emission lines and with\\nstrong BAL features as evidence for early quasar feedback.

Evidence of Quasar Feedback\\nCentral accreting SMBHs play an important role in shaping galaxy evolution (see review\\nby Fabian 2012). Indeed, to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxy masses at z= 0,\\nsimulations require that strong AGN feedback was already in place at z∼6 (e.g., Kaviraj\\net al. 2017). Below we list some of the observational evidence (with caveats) that these\\nfeedback mechanisms are taking place in the z≳6 quasar population:\\nUV Line Shifts. High-redshift quasars show asymmetric shape and velocity oﬀset of\\nhigh ionization lines, in particular the C ivline. The low-redshift quasar population shows\\nan overall blueshifted C ivline (∼800 km s−1) compared to the systemic redshift of the\\nquasar (e.g., traced by H β, Shen et al. 2011). This shift is generally understood in the\\ncontext of a strong accretion disk wind that contributes to the high-ionization lines (e.g.,\\nRichards et al. 2011). At z >6, the C ivline velocity shift is much stronger ( ∼1800 km\\ns−1, Schindler et al. 2020). Meyer et al. (2019) suggested that this redshift evolution can be\\nexplained by the C ivwinds being launched from the disk with an increased torus opacity\\nat this redshift.\\nBAL Quasars. A fraction of quasars show broad and highly blue-shifted absorption\\nfeatures in their rest-frame UV transitions. BAL features trace ionized winds in the broad\\nline region and are recognized signatures of SMBH feedback. Bischetti et al. (2022) used\\nhigh-quality spectra of quasars from the XQR30 survey to show that up to ∼50% of\\nluminous quasars at z∼6 exhibit BAL features (with outﬂow velocities up to 17% of\\nthe speed of light), compared to about 20% observed in low-redshift samples. Yang et al.\\n(2021) studied 37 quasars at 6 .3<z< 7.64 and reported a BAL fraction of ∼24%, smaller\\nthan the Bischetti et al. (2022) work but still slightly larger than what is observed at lower\\nredshifts. This potential evolution of the BAL fraction could be a result of the strong\\nfeedback associated with the rapid BH growth and galaxy assembly in the early Universe.\\nLyαhalos. The existence of extended Ly αnebulae around z≳6 quasars was discussed\\nin Section 5.1. Recently, Costa et al. (2022) performed a suite of cosmological, radiation-\\nhydrodynamic simulations to understand the origin and properties of the observed Ly α\\nhalos. The simulations unambiguously require quasar-powered outﬂows to match the ob-\\nserved properties at z≳6, providing indirect evidence for AGN feedback.\\nRadio jets . Only six galaxies hosting radio-loud quasars at z≳6 have been studied with\\nALMA and NOEMA (Rojas-Ruiz et al. 2021, Khusanova et al. 2022). Assuming no AGN\\ncontribution, their, their [C ii]- and FIR-derived star-formation properties are consistent\\nwith those reported for the much more studied radio-quiet quasars (c.f., Decarli et al. 2018,\\nVenemans et al. 2020; see Fig. 8). However, Rojas-Ruiz et al. (2021) and Khusanova et al.\\n(2022) show indirect evidence that the FIR emission of radio-loud quasars can be strongly\\naﬀected by synchrotron emission. In that case, their IR-derived star formation rates can\\nbe overestimated, implying that we might be witnessing negative AGN feedback at z >6.\\nHowever, more measurements of the FIR continuum and/or an enlarged sample are required\\nto quantify the potential impact on the population.\\n28 Fan et al.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

Finkelstein & Bagley (2022) have synthesized measurements\\nacross the lierature of galaxy+AGN UV luminosity functions, to estimate their relative\\ncontributions to the ionizing photon budget, using strong assumptions about the ionizing\\nradiation escape fractions of each population. They estimate that AGN supply ∼10% of\\nthe total ionizing photon budget at z∼5, roughly the lower limit of redshifts considered in\\nour review. They found that this fraction drops rapidly toward higher redshift because of\\ndiﬀerential downward evolution in the quasar luminosity function relative to galaxies. By\\nz∼7 they estimate that AGN contribute only 0 .3−1.0% of all ionizing photons, declining\\nby yet another order of magnitude by z∼9. In contrast, Giallongo et al. (2019) suggested\\nthat AGN contributions to the UV background can still be signiﬁcant at z∼5.6 based on\\nX-ray selected objects.\\nThe quantitative uncertainties in these analyses are still considerable; Finkelstein et al.\\n(2019) found a 10 ×higher contribution from AGN at z∼7 using diﬀerent assumptions.\\nMuch of this may be attributed to uncertainties in the faint end slope of the quasar lu-\\nminosity function. Still, the qualitative picture that reionization is heavily dominated by\\nstar-forming galaxies appears to remain fairly robust with respect to these uncertainties.\\nThe fractional contribution of quasars and AGN increases toward lower redshift because of\\ntheir rapidly rising number densities, such that they are more likely to dominate the meta-\\ngalactic UV background in the at z <4 post-reionization universe. New surveys with the\\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and JWST should revolutionize this ﬁeld, providing\\nboth deep, near-IR color selected objects deep into the EoR, and also sensitive spectra to\\nconﬁrm the AGN nature of faint candidates and separate them from star-forming galaxies.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 31', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",

Unfortunately unlike He ii, it is not possible to measure heating from Hydrogen\\nreionization in “real time”, because Gunn-Peterson absorption fully blankets the signal at\\nthe redshifts of interest.

However measurements made\\nusing pairs of adjacent quasar sightlines can break this degeneracy, since they only measure\\nsmoothing on a transverse spatial scale by construction (Rorai et al. 2017).\\nSummarizing, while the power spectrum and thermal history cannot provide precision\\nconstraints on the timing of hydrogen reionization, it supports a general result that by\\nz∼5, the initial thermal energy injected into the IGM has already cooled substantially, by\\nperhaps a factor of 2 −3. This sets a lower bound on the elapsed time between the period\\nof thermal energy injection and z∼4−5 where the measurements are made. This in turn\\nimplies that the peak heating associated with reionization occurred at 7 <z< 10, broadly\\nconsistent with CMB results reported by Planck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020).\\n6.3.

While observationally convenient and consistent, this deﬁnition is not motivated\\nby any physical transition or process. It is loosely related to a radius of enhanced ionizing\\nbackground, but at a 10% ﬂux threshold the enhancement is still very strong — the quasar\\ncontribution exceeds the ambient ﬁeld by an order of magnitude (Eilers et al. 2017). In\\nselect cases one may compare Ly αand Lyβmeasurements to improve dynamic range in\\nanalogous fashion to IGM measurements (Mesinger & Haiman 2004).

There are two arguments now suggesting that this phenomenon is not aﬀecting IGM\\nmeasurements at z>7. First, none of the four sightlines listed above exhibit heavy-element\\nabsorption at the redshift of the putative DLA, to very sensitive limits. Second, the presence\\nof damping wings in multiple new z>7 discoveries points to a global phenomenon, as the\\njoint probability of seeing proximate DLAs in all of these becomes lower still.

Summary\\nSince the ﬁrst discoveries of reionization-era quasars more than twenty years ago, tremen-\\ndous progress has been made in extending the frontiers of quasar research deeper into the\\ncosmic dawn, in characterizing and understanding these objects in the context of early\\nSMBH growth and galaxy formation, and in using them as beacons to shed light on the\\nevolution of the IGM and the history of cosmic reionization.\\nSUMMARY POINTS\\n1. The current frontier of quasar research is at z∼7.6, with a large statistical sample\\nassembled at redshifts up to 7. High-redshift quasar selection is a challenging data\\nmining problem because of the rarity of the targets, the limited training sets, and\\nthe overwhelmingly large number of contaminant sources, both astrophysical and\\ninstrumental. We provide a database of the properties of all published quasars at\\nz>5.3 asSupplementary Material that accompanies this review.\\n2. The rapid evolution of the quasar LF has been well established. However, the\\nexact shape of the LF is still uncertain, both at the high luminosity end due to\\nsmall number statistics, and at the low luminosity end due to limitations of deep\\nsurveys. In sharp contrast, early quasars “look” almost identical to their low-\\nredshift counterparts in spectral properties. Even the earliest known quasars have\\na well-established AGN structure.\\n3. There are more than 100 z≳6 quasars with robust BH mass measurements. Their\\nmasses range from ∼4×107M⊙to∼1010M⊙. The BHs are growing at high Ed-\\ndington ratios ( λEﬀ,median = 0.79 andλEﬀ,mean = 0.92), with mild evidence of an\\nincrease of the accretion rate for z≳6.5 quasars in comparison to luminosity-\\nmatched quasar samples at lower redshifts.\\n4. The UV stellar light in z∼6 quasar hosts remains undetected, while on the other\\nhand, (sub)mm observations have revealed the existence of copious amounts of gas\\nand cold dust in many of these galaxies. Quasar hosts are massive, star-forming\\ngalaxies showing diverse morphology and kinematics; their average dynamical mass\\nappears lower than that based on the local scaling relation between BH and galaxy\\nmasses.\\n5. Lyαabsorption in quasars’ foreground IGM provides many of the most stringent\\nconstraints on the history of reionization, though the details of the observations\\nvary with redshift. Toward the end of reionization at z<6, counts of transmission\\n48 Fan et al.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='spikes, dark gaps, and pixel optical depths indicate that universe is mostly ionized,\\nbut may harbor substantial islands of neutral matter as late as z∼5.3. Atz >7,\\nfour quasars have been discovered with prominent, metal-free damping wings that\\nare thought to represent oﬀ-resonance absorption from an IGM with neutral fraction\\n>10%, and possibly as high as 80%.\\n6. Heavy element absorption is seen in quasar spectra well into the epoch of reioniza-\\ntion, tracing chemical feedback from stars whose radiation is also transforming the\\nglobal ionization balance. It appears that these absorbers are high-redshift, low-\\nmetallicity analogs of damped Ly αabsorbers observed at lower redshift. However\\nthe highly ionized phase of the circumgalactic medium, seen universally in CIV at\\nz <6, abruptly vanishes in the EoR. This either indicates that the metals in the\\nCGM are undergoing their own ionization transition, or that the ionized phase of\\nthe CGM has not yet been enriched with heavy elements at z>6.\\nFUTURE ISSUES\\n1. With the new facilities planned for the next decade, we expect the quasar redshift\\nfrontier to reach redshift 9–10, when the ﬁrst generation of luminous quasars is\\nforming. A key challenge will be the spectroscopic conﬁrmation of these faint high-\\nredshift sources.\\n2. SMBH mass measurements using the H βline with JWST and gas-dynamical esti-\\nmates with ALMA (and eventually the ngVLA) will provide more accurate measure-\\nments than what is currently possible. These results will be crucial to test whether\\nthe current methods calibrated at low redshift (e.g., Mg iisingle-epoch virial mass)\\nstill hold at the highest accessible redshifts. To measure the BH masses of the pro-\\ngenitors of the currently observed z= 6−7 quasar population, NIR spectroscopic\\nfollow-up with the ELTs will be key.\\n3. JWST will likely be able to ﬁnally reveal stellar light from z≳6 quasar hosts.\\nALMA will continue playing a critical role in understanding and characterizing the\\ninterstellar medium of quasar host galaxies via multi-line diagnostics.\\n4. New quasar samples uncovered by Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope and\\nobserved with JWST and ELTs should substantially improve conﬁdence in z≥7\\nmeasurements of IGM damping wings. They will allow studies even deeper into the\\npast.\\n5. JWST already shows promise of being transformative for surveys of galaxies in ﬁelds\\nwhere high-redshift quasars have been used to constrain the IGM density ﬁeld. This\\nmay open the possibility of studying cross-correlations between Ly α, metals, and\\ngalaxies.\\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\\nThe authors are not aware of any aﬃliations, memberships, funding, or ﬁnancial holdings\\nthat might be perceived as aﬀecting the objectivity of this review.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 49', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",

While the near-infrared (NIR) variability of Sgr A* was shown to be consistent\\nover two decades, unprecedented activity in 2019 challenges existing statistical models. We investigate\\nthe origin of this activity by re-calibrating and re-analyzing all of our Keck Observatory Sgr A* imaging\\nobservations from 2005-2022. We present light curves from 69 observation epochs using the NIRC2\\nimager at 2.12 µm with laser guide star adaptive optics. These observations reveal that the mean\\nluminosity of Sgr A* increased by a factor of ∼3 in 2019, and the 2019 light curves had higher variance\\nthan in all time periods we examined. We find that the 2020-2022 flux distribution is statistically\\nconsistent with the historical sample and model predictions, but with fewer bright measurements\\nabove 0.6 mJy at the ∼2σlevel. Since 2019, we have observed a maximum Ks(2.2µm) flux of 0.9\\nmJy, compared to the highest pre-2019 flux of 2.0 mJy and highest 2019 flux of 5.6 mJy. Our results\\nsuggest that the 2019 activity was caused by a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr A*, possibly due\\nto delayed accretion of tidally-stripped gas from the gaseous object G2 in 2014. We also examine faint\\nSgr A* fluxes over a long time baseline to search for a quasi-steady quiescent state. We find that Sgr\\nA* displays flux variations over a factor of ∼500, with no evidence for a quiescent state in the NIR.\\nKeywords: black hole physics, accretion, Galaxy: center, techniques: high angular resolution\\n1.INTRODUCTION\\nThe Milky Way’s Galactic center harbors the nearest\\nsupermassive black hole, providing a natural laboratory\\nfor detailed study of physical processes in its vicinity\\n(e.g. Sch¨ odel et al. 2003; Ghez et al. 2008).

While accretion processes have\\nbeen extensively studied in highly luminous active galac-\\ntic nuclei, Sgr A* is an example of the ubiquitous pop-\\nulation of low-luminosity galactic nuclei in the nearby\\nuniverse. By studying Sgr A*, we can learn more about\\naccretion processes in these systems (for recent reviews\\nsee Genzel et al. 2010; Morris et al. 2012).\\nNear-infrared (NIR) observations are particularly ef-\\nfective for monitoring the variability of Sgr A*.

The\\nNIR emission arises primarily from synchrotron radia-\\ntion very close ( ≲15 Schwarzschild radii) to the event\\nhorizon and can be used to bridge the radio and X-ray\\nbands to construct a coherent description of the emission\\nprocesses in radiatively-inefficient, advection-dominated\\nblack hole accretion flows (e.g. Fazio et al. 2018; Witzel\\net al. 2021).\\nThere have been numerous efforts to statistically char-\\nacterize the NIR variability. Do et al. (2009) showed\\nthat light curves from 2005-2007 can be described by a\\nred-noise process that is correlated in time and does not\\nexhibit periodicity or quasi-periodicity. Using observa-\\ntions from 2004-2009, Dodds-Eden et al. (2011) found\\nthe data to be described by a two-state model with a\\nlow-level log-normal component and a separate power-\\nlaw tail for flares. On the other hand, a recent com-\\nprehensive analysis of over 13,000 measurements of Sgr\\nA* flux density with Keck data at 2.12 µm (2003-2014)\\nand VLT and Spitzer data at 4.5 µm (2004-2017) found\\nthat the NIR time variability can indeed be consistently\\ndescribed by red noise, but that the entire distribution\\nof fluxes is well-fit by a single log-normal model without\\na separate flaring component (Witzel et al. 2018). By\\nre-analyzing speckle data from Keck (1995-2005), Chen\\net al. (2019) extended the time baseline of Sgr A* obser-\\nvations and showed that the statistical model of Witzel\\net al. (2018) remained consistent with the data over two\\ndecades through 2018.\\nHowever, in May 2019 Do et al. (2019) observed an\\nunprecedented bright NIR event with Keck. The flux of\\nSgr A* varied by a factor of 75 over a 2-hour timescale\\nand reached twice the level of any previous historical\\nNIR measurement. The maximum fluxes were observed\\nat the beginning of observations, suggesting that Sgr A*\\nwas likely even brighter prior to taking measurements\\nthat night. With additional bright events observed at\\nKeck in 2019, Do et al. (2019) showed the 2019 activ-\\nity to be inconsistent with the historical flux distribu-\\ntion of Witzel et al. (2018). Additionally, a high abun-\\ndance of bright NIR events were observed with VLT\\nin 2019 relative to other years (Gravity Collaboration\\net al. 2020). Heightened activity was also seen in the ra-\\ndio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al. 2022;\\nCheng et al. 2023) and X-ray regimes (e.g. Pavlinsky\\n2019; Degenaar et al. 2019). These observations collec-\\ntively suggest that Sgr A* displayed unusual behavior\\nin 2019, making this era useful for understanding the\\ntime-variable accretion flow onto the black hole.Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the\\nelevated 2019 activity. These possibilities and their ob-\\nservable signatures include the following.\\n1. The statistical models of Sgr A* in the NIR need\\nto be updated to capture the bright events. While\\nWitzel et al. (2018) found that historical mea-\\nsurements follow a single log-normal distribution,\\nGravity Collaboration et al. (2020) argues that\\nthe 2019 bright events observed by Keck and VLT\\nare rare events drawn from the power-law tail of\\nthe underlying two-state distribution described by\\nDodds-Eden et al. (2011). In such two-state mod-\\nels, the faint distribution arises from steady accre-\\ntion of mass from the black hole’s environment,\\nand the flaring state arises from a separate pro-\\ncess that injects additional energy. A related ques-\\ntion concerns whether there exists a quasi-steady,\\nquiescent “floor” to the Sgr A* light curves or\\nwhether Sgr A* displays similar variability char-\\nacteristics at both faint and high levels (e.g. Do\\net al. 2009). Previous studies have historically\\nbeen complicated by short time baselines or have\\nnot closely examined the faint end of the flux dis-\\ntribution. We can examine Sgr A* at low flux\\ndensities over a long time baseline to determine\\nwhether such a quiescent state exists and to study', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='not closely examined the faint end of the flux dis-\\ntribution. We can examine Sgr A* at low flux\\ndensities over a long time baseline to determine\\nwhether such a quiescent state exists and to study\\nwhether the statistical character of the emission\\nat faint flux densities is simply an extension of\\nwhat we see at higher flux densities. We can also\\nstudy whether the faint flux densities are different\\nin 2019 than in other years. If the 2019 events\\nare indicative of a power-law “flaring” state dis-\\ntinct from the log-normal “quiescent” state, we\\nshould see only the flaring state affected and the\\nfaint end of the flux distribution unchanged be-\\ntween 2019 and other years. A shift in the faint\\nend of the flux distribution in 2019 would instead\\nsuggest that Sgr A* experienced a physical change\\nduring this time.\\n2. There was a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr\\nA*. The Galactic center hosts a population of\\nstars and dusty G-objects, which could affect the\\naccretion flow. The star S0-2 underwent closest\\napproach in 2018, and its passage may have in-\\nduced an accretion disturbance (Loeb 2004). In\\nthe past two decades, the objects G1 and G2 un-\\nderwent closest approach and showed signs of tidal\\ninteraction with the black hole, causing much spec-\\nulation about the potential for excess material\\nfrom these objects to induce heightened Sgr A*\\nactivity (e.g. Gillessen et al. 2012; Phifer et al.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

While an increase in X-ray\\nflares was reported following G2’s passage in 2014\\n(Ponti et al. 2015), no exceptional NIR activity\\nwas reported in the years immediately following\\n2014. However, it is possible that there is a larger\\ntime delay between the passage of G2 and any ob-\\nserved NIR activity (e.g Kawashima et al. 2017;\\nMurchikova 2021). If a neighboring source, such as\\nS0-2 or G2, deposited gas or altered the accretion\\nflow onto Sgr A*, we would expect to see height-\\nened activity for the duration of time it takes that\\nmaterial to fall into the black hole, followed by a\\nreturn to more typical behavior.\\n3. Sgr A* has entered a new accretion state in which\\nbright flares are more common, or the 2019 ac-\\ntivity is a precursor to an even larger event (Do\\net al. 2019). Observations of X-ray light echoes\\nfrom iron line emission at the Galactic center sug-\\ngest that in the past several hundred years, Sgr\\nA* has undergone multiple ( ∼2-10 year) luminos-\\nity increases by factors of up to 105(e.g. Ponti\\net al. 2010; Clavel et al. 2013; Terrier et al. 2018;\\nChuard et al. 2018). If Sgr A* is undergoing a state\\nchange or entering an extreme episode, we should\\nsee the activity of Sgr A* continue or evolve in the\\nyears beyond 2019.\\nTo test these hypotheses, we must compare the be-\\nhavior of Sgr A* before, during, and after 2019 at both\\nlow and high flux densities. Previous studies used dif-\\nferent photometric methods (e.g. aperture photometry,\\npoint spread function fitting, interferometry) and vary-\\ning treatments for stellar contamination of Sgr A*, mak-\\ning the comparison of absolute flux densities unreliable,\\nespecially at fainter levels. In this work, we present\\nSgr A* observations using Keck Observatory from 2005-\\n2022, all reduced with the same methodology, allowing\\nfor a robust comparison of flux densities over time.

Keck observations\\nOur observations of the Galactic center were taken\\nwith the Keck 2 Telescope using the narrow camera in\\nthe Near-Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2) imager with the\\nLaser-Guide Star Adaptive Optics (LGS AO) system\\n(Wizinowich et al. 2006).

Standard image reduction meth-\\nods were applied, including flat-fielding, sky subtraction,\\nand cosmic ray removal via the Keck AO Imaging (KAI)\\ndata reduction pipeline (Lu et al. 2021).\\nPhotometry was performed on individual images to\\nconstruct light curves for Sgr A*. We used the point\\nspread function (PSF) fitting program Starfinder to\\nmeasure the brightness and position of sources (Diolaiti\\net al. 2000). Using the same procedure as in Do et al.\\n(2019), a different PSF was constructed for each image\\nto account for changes in effective PSF due to seeing\\nvariations. To increase the number of Sgr A* detec-\\ntions at faint flux levels, we used an enhanced version\\nofStarfinder that includes a priori knowledge of the\\nlocation of Sgr A* and other nearby NIR sources (Horn-\\nstein et al. 2007). For each epoch, the source locations\\nin a nightly-averaged image were used as fixed inputs\\ninto Starfinder to more accurately fit for Sgr A* and\\nneighboring sources in the individual frames.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='6\\nThe flux distributions of Sgr A* reveal that flux densi-\\nties in 2019 were elevated at both faint and bright levels,\\nand that the post-2019 activity of Sgr A* is statistically\\nconsistent with the pre-2019 activity. We construct his-\\ntograms of the light curves and present the flux distribu-\\ntions for the pre-2019 (2005-2017), 2019, and post-2019\\n(2020-2022) epochs in Figure 1. In our sample, Sgr A*\\nis detected ∼93% of the time. Our treatment of non-\\ndetections is discussed in Appendix E.\\nAs shown in Do et al. (2019), the 2019 distribution\\nhas a tail extending to high flux densities that is not\\npresent before 2019. Our post-2019 results show no such\\nextended tail, indicating that we have seen no high flux\\ndensities at 2019 levels in more recent years. We observe\\nthat the shapes of the pre- and post-2019 distributions\\nappear to be quite similar, whereas the 2019 distribution\\nappears skewed to higher flux densities.\\nWe are also able to measure the long-term median\\nof the flux distribution, enabled by our consistent re-\\nduction methodology with photometric corrections for\\nstellar confusion. We find that the median of the 2019\\ndistribution is 0.20 mJy (1.9 mJy dereddened), which\\ndoubles the 0.10 mJy (1.0 mJy dereddened) medians of\\nthe pre- and post-2019 distributions. Other percentiles\\nof the flux distribution are presented in Table 2. We\\nobserve that in addition to the median, the flux levels of\\n2019 are elevated at all percentiles compared to the pre-\\nceding and succeeding distributions, demonstrating that\\nthe 2019 behavior was indeed unusual beyond merely\\nthe extremely bright event of 2019-05-13. On the other\\nhand, nearly all percentiles are similar between the pre-\\nand post-2019 distributions. The exception is at the\\nhigh flux end, where discrepancies between the pre- and\\npost-2019 distributions are explained by a recent lack of\\nbright flux excursions. Furthermore, by adding our flux\\ndistributions and dividing by the number of observations\\nwithin each time period, we can compare the average lu-\\nminosity of Sgr A* at 2.12 µm. We find that Sgr A* was\\non average ∼3 times more luminous at this wavelength\\nin 2019 than in the pre-2019 observations. Since 2019,\\nSgr A* has had an average luminosity of ∼0.9 times its\\npre-2019 luminosity.\\nWe can use two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests\\nto quantitatively compare our flux distributions. We\\nnote that KS-tests assume independent measurements\\nand Sgr A* light curves are time-correlated on an intra-\\nnight basis; however, as in Do et al. (2019), we can\\ncompare flux distributions with multiple nights of ob-\\nservations that are uncorrelated with one another to\\nroughly compare the general behavior of Sgr A* over\\nlong time periods. We use the inferred flux distributions\\n(described in Appendix E) to mitigate the bias inducedby non-detections. Performing a KS-test between our\\npre-2019 and 2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of\\n0.39 ( p≪1), showing it is highly unlikely that these\\ndata sets come from the same underlying distribution.\\nDo et al. (2019) also used a KS-test and found a large\\ndisagreement between the 2019 sample and historical\\ndata. Performing a KS-test between our 2019 and post-\\n2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of 0.36 ( p≪1),\\nshowing these data sets are also highly unlikely to come\\nfrom the same underlying distribution. On the other\\nhand, performing a KS-test between our pre-2019 and\\npost-2019 distributions yields a much lower KS-statistic\\nof 0.04 ( p∼0.03), showing these distributions are more\\nsimilar. If we restrict our KS-test to flux densities above\\n0.05 mJy (where non-detections become negligible), we\\nfind a comparable KS-statistic of 0.05 ( p∼0.01). Based\\non these results, we find that the pre-2019 and post-2019\\nflux distributions of Sgr A* agree at the ∼2σlevel.\\nFigure 1.

The flux dis-\\ntribution and percentiles with this night removed can be\\nfound in Appendix F. We find that the removal of this\\nnight certainly impacts the high end of the flux distri-\\nbution, but the median of the distribution remains the\\nsame and the peak of the distribution remains shifted to\\nhigher flux levels with respect to the historical distribu-\\ntion.

As such, we conclude that our finding that\\nthe 2019 flux distribution is significantly different is ro-\\nbust whether or not the brightest night is included. The\\ninclusion of this night only bolsters the result.\\n3.2. Bright events in the NIR Sgr A* light curve\\nThe light curve of Sgr A* over 17 years shows the\\nheightened flux densities in 2019 and relative lack of ac-\\ntivity in the following years (see Figure 3). To construct\\nthis light curve, we stitch together the pre-2019, 2019,\\nand post-2019 data and remove time gaps between ob-\\nservation epochs. Individual light curves from each of\\nthese three subsets displaying both bright and faint flux\\ndensities are shown in Appendix G.\\nWe find no bright fluxes in the post-2019 data at the\\nlevel of the two brightest events in 2019. In six nights of\\n2019 observations, the two brightest events have maxi-\\nmum flux densities of 5.58 ±0.04 mJy (corresponding to\\n53.8 mJy dereddened) and 1.56 ±0.03 mJy (15.0 mJy\\ndereddened). In seven nights of observations in 2020\\nand 2021, the highest flux density measured is only 0.60\\n±0.04 mJy (5.8 mJy dereddened). In 11 observation\\nepochs in 2022, we observed only two bright flux excur-\\nsions with maximum flux densities of 0.74 ±0.06 mJy\\n(7.1 mJy dereddened) and 0.93 ±0.03 mJy (9.0 mJy\\ndereddened). Neither of these are comparable to the\\n2019 events.\\nThere is also a lack of bright flux excursions in the\\npost-2019 data as compared to the pre-2019 data. We\\nobserve four events in the pre-2019 data (counting two\\non 2010-05-05) with flux densities greater than 1 mJy\\nand no flux densities at this level post-2019. Six events\\nwith flux densities greater than 0.8 mJy are observed in\\nthe pre-2019 data, and only one is observed post-2019.\\nThe post-2019 sample is only ∼43% as long as the pre-\\n2019 sample, but there remains a relative absence of\\nbright fluxes in more recent years.\\n3.3. Sgr A* has no quiescent state in the NIR\\nOur new methodology allows for measurements of\\nfaint flux densities in the NIR over 17 years and the abil-\\nity to search for a quiescent, quasi-steady state. Such a\\nstate would present itself as a “floor” to the Sgr A* light\\ncurve. This study is the first to examine faint Sgr A*\\nflux densities from 2005-2022 while making corrections\\nfor stellar confusion, allowing for reliable comparisons of\\nfaint Sgr A* flux densities over a long time baseline to\\nsearch for such a floor.We find that there is no quasi-steady floor to the NIR\\nSgr A* light curve at faint flux densities. When viewed\\nin linear flux space (such as the upper light curve in Fig-\\nure 3), Sgr A* does appear to spend most of its time in\\na faint state that is punctuated by bright “flares”. How-\\never, the data show that Sgr A* has been highly variable\\neven at low flux densities over 17 years. By examining\\nthe light curve in logarithmic flux density space (bottom\\nlight curve in Figure 3), we see that Sgr A* shows no qui-\\nescent state in the NIR and instead displays stochastic\\nvariability over a factor of ∼500 in flux. Flux densities\\ndo not level off at some faint value, but are continuously\\nand significantly variable down to about 0.01 mJy (0.1\\nmJy dereddened), which is the limit where we are able\\nto detect Sgr A* with >1σconfidence and which only a\\nsmall fraction of frames likely fall below.\\n3.4.

Our struc-\\nture functions reveal that greater average luminosity in\\n2019 correlates with more extreme variability, and the\\nlower average luminosity post-2019 correlates with rela-\\ntively diminished variability.\\n4.DISCUSSION\\nOur results show that the 2019 flux distribution was\\nshifted to higher levels and had larger variance. In 2020-\\n2022, the behavior of Sgr A* was statistically similar,\\nbut slightly diminished compared to that of 2005-2017.\\nWe also find that Sgr A* has no quiescent state over 17\\nyears of NIR observations. These findings have implica-\\ntions for understanding the time-variable accretion flow\\nonto Sgr A*.\\nThe pronounced shift in the 2019 median flux density\\nsuggests that Sgr A* experienced a heightened accretion\\nrate, revealing that the 2019 NIR activity was extraor-\\ndinary beyond just the bright events. Gravity Collabo-\\nration et al. (2020) also reported an elevated median in\\n2019 (compared to the years 2017 and 2018), although\\nit was found not statistically significant given the num-\\nber of observations over a time baseline of 3 years. Our\\ntime baseline of 17 years provides stronger evidence for\\na shift in the median of the flux distribution in 2019.\\nThe two-state model for the flux distribution with a log-\\nnormal quiescent state and power-law tail (Dodds-Eden\\net al. 2011; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020) interprets\\nbright flares as manifestations of such a tail, but does\\nnot account for the changes to the faint emission that we\\nobserve in 2019 in this study. Because we see elevated\\nactivity at both low and high levels in 2019, explana-\\ntions invoking a physical change to Sgr A*’s accretion\\nstate are favored over a new statistical model.\\nMulti-wavelength observations of Sgr A* in 2019 also\\nfavor a physical change to the accretion flow. The tem-\\nporal concentration of high fluxes observed in 2019 by\\nKeck and VLT in the NIR, as well as heightened activ-\\nity in radio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al.\\n2022; Cheng et al. 2023) and X-rays (e.g. Pavlinsky 2019;\\nDegenaar et al. 2019) is also evidence for a physical dis-\\nturbance during 2019. If Sgr A*’s variability were bet-\\nter characterized by a different underlying distribution\\nthan that of Witzel et al. (2018) (a single stochastic pro-\\ncess with a log-normal distribution), we would expect tosee bright events and elevated multi-wavelength activity\\nmore evenly distributed over two decades, rather than\\nclustered together in a single year.\\nOur results favor models in which extra gas was de-\\nposited onto the black hole in 2019, temporarily increas-\\ning the accretion rate and stimulating the production of\\nfrequent bright events. Such models include a distur-\\nbance induced by the closest approach of the star S0-2\\nin 2018 or the delayed infall of gas pulled from a tidal in-\\nteraction with the dusty object G2 in 2014. Kawashima\\net al. (2017) predicted a time-delayed radio and infrared\\nbrightening of Sgr A* around 2020 caused by the pas-\\nsage of G2. In their simulations, the magnetic energy\\nwithin the accretion disk increases by a factor of 3-4 af-\\nter∼5 years following the passage of G2. Murchikova\\n(2021) calculates that the infall time of material from G2\\n(and the possible simultaneous infall of material from\\nthe object G1) more closely matches the time delay be-\\ntween pericenter passage and flaring time than that of\\nS0-2. Hydrodynamic simulations have also shown that\\nwinds from the passage of S0-2 are unlikely to have a\\nmeasurable effect on the inner accretion flow (Ressler\\net al. 2018). If the 2019 activity was indeed caused by a\\ntemporary accretion increase, these findings collectively\\nfavor the G2 hypothesis over the S0-2 hypothesis as a\\nsource for the excess material.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Recent\\nobservations with NIR interferometry (e.g. Gravity Col-\\nlaboration et al. 2020) have improved angular resolution\\nand reduced the impact of confusion on flux measure-\\nments, but such observations of Sgr A* have only be-\\ngun in 2017. Single-telescope data is complementary to\\ninterferometric data because it offers a long time base-\\nline to compare the behavior of Sgr A* across decades,\\nbut as in this work, care must be taken to account for\\nconfusion. Future work to combine single-telescope and\\ninterferometric data sets would help reduce systematics\\nin the study of Sgr A* variability.\\n5.CONCLUSION\\nEach hypothesis for the 2019 activity of Sgr A* is\\nscientifically plausible for understanding the activity in\\nterms of an excess accretion flow onto the black hole.\\nIf we are able to trace the activity to S0-2 or G2, we\\nwill directly connect the supermassive black hole’s feed-\\ning behavior to an object in its vicinity and learn more\\nabout how neighboring objects supply material for the\\nblack hole to accrete. If Sgr A* has undergone a change\\nof state, we will catch a real-time glimpse into the phys-\\nical response of a supermassive black hole accretion flow\\nto an increase in gas flow. In any case, it is important to\\ndetermine whether the 2019 activity is representative of\\nSgr A*’s typical behavior or a period of extraordinary\\nactivity. If the former, the 2019 activity should be in-\\ncluded in long-term models of Sgr A*. If the latter, the\\nunusual behavior should be treated as a separate period\\nwith distinct physical characteristics.\\nTo investigate the origin of the 2019 activity, we have\\ndone the following:\\n•Performed a consistent reduction of Keck Sgr A*\\nobservations from 2005-2022 with new treatment\\nfor stellar confusion to enable a robust comparison\\nof flux densities over nearly two decades\\n•Demonstrated that both faint and bright 2019 flux\\ndensities were significantly elevated with respect\\nto pre- and post-2019 observations\\n•Shown that the average luminosity of Sgr A* was\\n∼3 times higher than historical measurements in\\n2019 and ∼0.9 times historical measurements in\\nthe years 2020-2022\\n•Shown that while the post-2019 observations are\\nstatistically consistent with the historical sample,\\nas well as with the statistical model of Witzel et al.(2018), we have observed a relative deficiency in\\nactivity in 2020-2022 at the ∼2σlevel\\n•Demonstrated that 2019 showed heightened vari-\\nability with respect to the years before and after,\\nindicating that a greater average luminosity seems\\ncorrelated with more extreme variability\\n•Found no evidence for a NIR quiescent state of Sgr\\nA*; Sgr A* displays stochastic flux variations over\\na factor of ∼500 and is continuously variable down\\nto about 0.01 mJy\\nWe argue that the observed increase in NIR flux den-\\nsities in 2019, along with the concentration of bright\\nevents measured by many observatories that year, points\\nto a transient increase in accretion activity during 2019.\\nIn these models, excess gas is temporarily deposited onto\\nthe black hole from the closest approach of a nearby ob-\\nject, raising the median flux and increasing the probabil-\\nity of bright events. Numerical simulations and analytic\\ncalculations have favored the black hole’s tidal interac-\\ntion with G2 in 2014 as a source for this excess material.\\nFurther modeling of G-object interactions with the ac-\\ncretion flow and their ability to cause the 2019 activity\\nshould be done to provide a more robust comparison to\\nobservations.\\nWe have ruled out the hypothesis that 2019 is a pre-\\ncursor to a long-term elevated accretion state, as the\\ncurrent behavior of Sgr A* resembles its behavior be-\\nfore 2019, and we have seen a lack of high fluxes in more\\nrecent years.

The magnitude difference between the previous and new photometric calibrations for sources in the central 10\\narcseconds is 0 .093±0.003 and in the central 1 arsecond in 0 .096±0.003, with stars being systematically fainter in the\\nnew calibration (see Figure 5). In this work, we used the following calibrator stars: IRS 16NW, S3-22, S1-17, S1-34,\\nS4-3, S1-1, S1-21, S3-370, S3-88, S3-36, and S2-63. We derived reference flux measurements for the selected calibrator\\nstars using the Sch¨ odel et al. (2010) photometric catalog transformed to the Keck NIRC2 bandpasses. The procedure\\nto transform fluxes from VLT NACO KsandH-bands to Keck NIRC2 K′andH-bands is described in more detail in\\nGautam et al. (2019). More details of our new photometric calibration are forthcoming in Gautam et al. in prep.\\nPhotometric uncertainties were estimated by fitting a power law between the flux level and RMS flux uncertainty\\nfor stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*, as described in Do et al. (2009). We then used this relationship to calculate\\nthe uncertainty in flux measurements for Sgr A*. The photometric uncertainties are generally less than 15% for\\nlow flux values ( ≲0.2 mJy) and less than 5% for high flux values ( ≳0.2 mJy). Sample power law fits to determine\\nflux measurement uncertainties are shown in Figure 6. The flux uncertainties for central arcsecond sources are not\\nsignificantly different between the previous and new photometric calibrations.\\nFigure 5. Comparison of observed magnitudes for Galactic center sources between the photometric calibration of Do et al. (2019) and\\nthe new calibration in this work (Gautam et al. in prep.), as a function of magnitude in the new calibration. We see that sources are\\nsystematically fainter by about 10% with the new calibration.\\nB.PHOTOMETRIC STABILITY\\nWe investigate the photometric stability of our observations by constructing flux distributions for two comparison\\nstars, S1-1 and S1-33, that are known to not be variable and span nearly an order of magnitude in flux (Gautam et al. in\\nprep). The pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 flux distributions of these stars and the nightly mean and standard deviation\\nof the fluxes are presented in Figure 7. We find that the differences between the means and standard deviations of the\\nflux distributions of these stars is not significant between the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 eras. The total 2005-2022\\nflux distribution for S1-1 can be described by a Gaussian with a width of ∼3%, and that of S1-33 can be described by\\na Gaussian with a width of ∼5%. The scatter of mean flux levels between individual nights for S1-1 is ∼2% and for\\nS1-33 is ∼4%. Within individual nights, the average scatter is ∼1% for S1-1 and ∼3% for S1-33. As such, between\\nall of our observations we are able to consistently reproduce the fluxes of S1-1 and S1-33 at the level of a few percent.\\nThe fluctuations in flux density for these non-variable stars are much smaller than the variations in Sgr A* flux density\\nthat we find, indicating that the shifts in the Sgr A* flux distributions that we report are photometrically robust.\\nC.OBSERVATION EPOCHS OMITTED\\nIn Section 2.2, we describe the successive cuts made to our sample to ensure robust photometry and comparisons of\\nSgr A* activity over time. Out of the 104 Galactic center K′observing epochs taken with Keck from 2005-2022, the\\n35 that we have omitted from our analysis are given in Table 4, along with the reasons for omission.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

In this study, we seek to measure the shift in the median of the flux distribution between 2019 and\\nother years to examine the accretion flow, so we take a new approach to characterizing confusion.\\nTo correct for the flux bias attributed to Sgr A* for epochs when a known star is within the confusion limit, we\\nsubtract a value informed from simulations of stellar confusion with Sgr A*. We injected synthetic stars near Sgr A* in\\na series of five unconfused images from 2014-05-19 with characteristic data quality (Strehl ratio ∼0.27) and median Sgr\\nA* flux levels ( ∼0.1 mJy), noting that our results are relatively insensitive to these choices within the uncertainties. In\\neach set of images, we planted stars at distances from 0-100 mas (randomly oriented) and K′brightnesses from 14-18\\nmag, then ran Starfinder on the simulated images. See Figure 12 for sample images from our injection procedure. By\\nsubtracting out the known unconfused flux of Sgr A* from our detected value, we are able to obtain an estimate for\\nthe photometric bias induced by the stellar injections. The results of this procedure can be found in Table 7. We also\\nmeasure the position of Sgr A* and report the astrometric biases in Table 8. For injections below 60 mas, the source\\nand Sgr A* are almost always detected as a combined source, making the confusion correction reliable. However, from\\n∼60-80 mas, Sgr A* and the injected star are sometimes detected together, individually, or not at all–with varying flux\\ndensities in each case. While no confusion corrections for 60-80 mas were needed in this study, future studies should\\ntreat this range with care by determining whether Starfinder is detecting Sgr A* and the confused star separately\\nor together. Beyond 80 mas, Sgr A* is unambiguously detected with photometric biases consistent with zero, so no\\ncorrections are needed for stars at these distances.\\nFor the observation epochs affected by stellar confusion, we determined the distance of the confusing star from Sgr\\nA* by performing an orbital fit to aligned images of the Galactic center and obtaining the predicted distance at the', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

In this work, we have excluded epochs in which the bright star S0-2 falls within 60 mas of Sgr A* (July\\n2017-2018), as the uncertainties on S0-2’s flux bias correction are comparable to faint Sgr A* flux levels.

The current highest redshift quasar host\\ndetected3, atz=4.5, required the magnifying effect of a foreground lensing galaxy. Low-luminosity\\nquasars4,5,6from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)7mitigate the\\nchallenge of detecting their underlying, previously-undetected host galaxies. Here we report rest-\\nframe optical images and spectroscopy of two HSC-SSP quasars at z>6with JWST . Using NIRCam\\nimaging at 3.6 µm and 1.5 µm and subtracting the light from the unresolved quasars, we find that\\nthe host galaxies are massive (stellar masses of 13×and3.4×1010M⊙, respectively), compact, and\\ndisk-like. NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy shows stellar absorption lines in the more\\nmassive quasar, confirming the detection of the host. Velocity-broadened gas in the vicinity of these\\nquasars enables measurements of their black hole masses ( 1.4×109and2.0×108M⊙, respectively).\\nTheir location in the black hole mass - stellar mass plane is consistent with the distribution at low\\nredshift, suggesting that the relation between black holes and their host galaxies was already in\\nplace less than a billion years after the Big Bang.\\nThe quasars J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 (coordinates listed in Extended Data Table 1) are at redshifts\\nof6.40and6.34. They have relatively low luminosity ( M1450=−23.87and−23.66mag, respectively),\\nroughly 10 times less luminous than typical bright quasars at these redshifts8,9,10. Using JWST with\\nNIRCam11, we observed J2236+0032 on November 6, 2022 and J2255+0251 on October 26, 2022. Images\\nwere taken in two broad-band filters (F356W and F150W) to detect their host galaxies at 3.56 and 1.50 µm,\\nthus bracketing the rest-frame 4000 Å break, a characteristic feature of galaxy spectra which constrains\\nthe age of the stellar population. Total exposure times were approximately 3,100 seconds for each filter\\nper target.\\nIn Figure 1, we show a 24′′×24′′region and zoomed-in cutouts of the JWST images centered on\\nthe quasars for both filters. As expected, both quasars are detected at high significance. The first\\nquasar J2236+0032 ( mF356W =21.75±0.02mag, mF150W =22.78±0.02,) has no evidence of close\\nneighbors.

We perform a two-component\\nmodel fit of the rest-frame optical emission in a region of the NIRCam images centered on each target.\\nWe use the software galight12to identify stars from each image to model the two-dimensional (2D)\\npoint-spread function (PSF). We then model each quasar image in each filter as a sum of a point-like quasar\\nand an extended host. The host galaxy was modeled using a 2D Sérsic profile13whose parameters include\\nthe position, size (R eff), axis ratio, orientation, flux, and the radial profile/shape of the light distribution\\n(i.e., Sérsic index), allowing a flexible description of the a priori unknown host galaxy shape. In Extended\\nData Table 1, we report the best-fit parameters and their uncertainties based on the dispersion resulting\\nfrom different PSF models with different modeling techniques (see Methods).\\nAs shown in Figure 2, we detect the host galaxies for both targets, which are visible after subtracting\\nthe quasar point-source model (third column). For J2236+0032, the quasar host is significantly detected\\nin both filters ( mF356W =23.12±0.20mag; mF150W =25.12±0.29mag). The inferred host-to-total flux\\nratios are 25.5±4.4%, and 10.2±2.8%with sizes (R eff) of0.7±0.1kpc and 0.5±0.2kpc for F356W\\nand F150W, respectively. The light distribution is elongated in the same direction (i.e., NE–SW) in the\\ntwo filters, suggesting a mildly inclined disk-like host. For this target, we fix the Sérsic index to 1in both\\nbands – corresponding to an exponential disk model – to avoid non-physical fits; this is supported by a\\nsubsequent fit to the host galaxy emission after subtracting the quasar (see Methods). For J2255+0251,\\nthe host galaxy is clearly detected in the F356W band ( mF356W =24.58±0.30mag) with a host-to-total\\nflux ratio of 9.8±2.6%. The host emission extends southeast (left) of the quasar’s location. The size of\\nthe host is inferred to be R eff=1.5±1.1kpc with a Sérsic index of 1.5±1.4, suggesting a more disk-like\\nthan spheroidal profile. The host galaxy is not detected in the F150W image, resulting in an upper limit\\nofmF150W=26.3mag (see Methods). This upper limit provides an important constraint on the galaxy\\nspectral energy distribution (SED). A non-detection is not surprising, given the low host-to-total flux ratio\\nin the F356W band and the fact that galaxies are typically fainter blueward of the 4000 Å break. We\\nuse NIRSpec14observations to demonstrate that the contribution of extended line emission to the host\\nphotometry in F356W is minimal (See Methods).\\nOur two photometric bands lie on either side of the 4000 Å break, allowing us to quantify the\\ncontributions of young and relatively old stars, and thus to estimate the stellar masses of the two quasar\\nhost galaxies. We fit the SED of each host with a single stellar population, in which the stellar metallicity\\nlogZ/Z⊙is constrained to the range [−1,−0.3], the stellar age is within the range [0.01,0.84]Gyr (capped\\nby the age of the universe at redshift 6.4), and the extinction A vis in the range of [0,5.0]mag. With\\nstandard assumptions on the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF), we find that J2236+0032 has a stellar mass\\nof1.3+2.0\\n−0.6×1011M⊙, while J2255+0251 is less massive with 3.4+7.6\\n−1.9×1010M⊙. We use simulations and\\nthree different SED fitting codes to demonstrate that the results are robust, although further observations\\nwill lessen potential systematic errors in these mass estimates (see Methods for full details on our mass\\nestimates and their uncertainties).

We used the INTRAMODULEBOX andSTANDARD dithering patterns for the primary\\nand sub-pixel dithers, respectively. We used the BRIGHT1 readout mode.\\nThe data were processed using the standard procedures in JWST pipeline version 1.7.2.

The difficulty of modeling the PSF has not allowed quasar host galaxies to\\nbe detected significantly beyond z≳3(ref. 1,2,28,29), where host starlight can be only measured through\\nthe SED fitting method30.\\nHere, we follow our tested strategy12, including the analysis of JWST images32, and build a PSF\\nlibrary by identifying all isolated, unsaturated stars of sufficient signal-to noise ratio (SNR) in our\\nimages. We identified 12 |16 PSF stars in filter F150W |F356W for J2236+0032 and 9 |5 PSF stars in\\nfilter F150W |F356W in the images for J2255+0251. We use our two-dimensional modeling software\\ngalight12to fit the quasar images with a model of a scaled PSF (the spatially unresolved point-like\\nquasar) and a PSF-convolved 2D Sérsic profile (the host galaxy). galight is apython -based open-\\nsource package2that utilizes the image modeling capabilities of lenstronomy31. It has been adopted\\nfor quasar decomposition of images by HST12,JWST32, and the HSC survey33. We adopt uniform priors\\nfor the effective radius R eff∈[0.′′03,2.′′0]and the Sérsic index ( n)∈[0.3,9]of the host to avoid unphysical\\nparameter inference. For J2255+0251, there is one nearby object which we fit simultaneously with a Sérsic\\nprofile, allowing us to correct for its effect on the host galaxy properties.\\nWe obtain a weighted inference for the decomposition result as briefly described here. After subtracting\\nthe remaining local background, we use each PSF in our library in turn to fit the image. The performance\\nof each PSF is determined by its best-fit χ2value. We select groups of two, three, and five PSFs from the\\nlibrary that have the top level χ2performance and then average them using psfr (Birrer et al. in prep).\\nTo optimize our modeling of the unresolved quasar emission, we consider both best-fit models using\\nindividual stars and average models based on the combined PSF stars described above. Thus, we add the\\nthree averaged PSFs as new members to the PSF library. We take the results from the five top-performing\\nPSF models in the updated library. We determine our final result parameters by weighting their χ2values,\\nas defined by ref. 12, Eq. (3)-(6). The uncertainties we quote are based on the dispersion in the host\\nproperties from these five different PSF models. Errors based on variation in the PSF models are often\\nsignificantly larger than the formal fitting errors, as has been recently demonstrated using simulations and\\nobservations of quasars and their host galaxies34. The final inferred host filter magnitude, size, Sérsic\\nindex, and other fit parameters are presented in Extended Data Table 1. The images in Figure 2 are based\\non the PSF with the best performance. The sizes of our host galaxies are defined using the Sérsic effective\\nradius R effalong the semi-major axis measured by galight .\\nThe quasar host of J2236+0032 appears to be a compact galaxy. As a result, we find that the Sérsic n\\nis poorly constrained, and the resulting host residual is point-like with an inferred R effof0.′′03(the lower\\nlimit of the prior), indicating that the central PSF has not been fully removed. This model implies a stellar\\nmass with an implausibly high value above 1011.8M⊙given the SED fitting described below. Thus, we\\nrefit this object, fixing n=1in both F356W and F150W.

For\\ninstance, a sub-pixel shift of the PSF is typically needed to optimally align with the position of the quasar.\\nThis interpolation within a pixel can result in modest variations in the allocation of flux between the\\nquasar and its host galaxy. In galight , the parameter point_source_supersampling_factor\\ncontrols this interpolation. For guidance here on the optimal setting, we compared our results with the\\ndecomposition from galfit35while implementing different supersampling factor values, i.e., 1 (no\\ninterpolation) and 2. The choice of supersampling factor had a greater impact on the F150W decomposi-\\ntion than that on the F356W image. We found that the two codes are in close agreement when using a\\nsupersampling_factor of 2 as shown in Extended Data Figure 2 and reported in Extended Data\\nTable 1. As a result, to account for the uncertainty associated with this setting, we report the averaged\\nresults obtained using both supersampling_factor values of 1 and 2, with uncertainties covered by\\nthese two settings.\\nTests of the robustness of the host galaxy properties\\nWe perform several sanity checks for our two quasars to confirm that the detections of their host galaxies\\nare real. First, our final reduced data are co-added using 16 dithers. To check whether the apparent host is\\ncaused by a random ghost from any particular dither frame, we reanalyze the data using the first 8 and the\\nsecond 8 dithers separately. We are able to detect the host from both halves of the data. To ensure that the\\napparent host galaxy flux is not dominated by a mismatched PSF core, we mask the quasar center (using a\\n0.′′12and0.′′06radius aperture for F356W and F150W, respectively) and redo the fit. Again, the host is\\nwell-detected.\\nTo rule out the possibility that the residual emission (host galaxy) is an artifact of the chosen PSF stars,\\nwe selected the five top-performing PSF in the library, and identified twenty pairs from these. We then fit\\none PSF with the other without assuming any host component for all pairs. We performed this test for stars\\nin the fields of J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 in both bands; residual images show no extended features\\nin any case. This is illustrated for J2255+0251 in the F356W filter in the top panels of Extended Data\\nFigure 3. We also fit galaxy + host models to pure PSF images, in which case the inferred host magnitudes\\nwere roughly two magnitudes fainter than the hosts detected around the quasars. In contrast, we clearly\\ndetect the quasar host when we use any of the five library PSFs and, using these stellar residual maps to\\nmeasure the standard deviation, we display the maps of the host signal-to-noise ratio for all images of our\\ntwo quasars in the bottom panels of Extended Data Figure 3.\\nWe carried out three sets of simulations to further validate our host detections, including J2255+0251\\nin the F356W filter and J2236+0032 in the F356W and F150W filters. In one realization of the simulation,\\nwe randomly select a PSF from the five top-ranked PSFs in the library, and add a Sérsic profile using the\\nbest-fit parameters from our model inference.

The host galaxy of J2255+0251 is not detected in the F150W filter, thus we\\ntake 26.3mag as a lower limit on the magnitude. We adopt a Chabrier IMF in our analysis to allow direct\\ncomparison with the local black hole - host galaxy mass relations (e.g., ref. 21,22). Contributions of\\nnebular emission lines from the host galaxies are also allowed with a uniform log ionization parameter\\nlogUover the range [−3,−1]. Three key parameters define the shape of the SED template: age, metallicity,\\nand dust attenuation (A v). We adopt a uniform prior on the age over the range [0.01, 0.84] (in Gyr),\\nextending to the age of the universe at z=6.4. We adopt a uniform prior in metallicity logZ/Z⊙over\\nthe range [−1,−0.3]following ref. 36,37. We assume an A vrange of [0, 5.0] mag for both targets. For\\nJ2255+0251, the F150W band has an upper limit on the flux thus the constraint on A vis weaker; hence,\\nwe assume A vfollows a log-normal distribution with a median value at 0.85 as supported by recent JWST\\nobservations of high-redshift galaxies38. A measurement of the Balmer decrement (i.e., the ratio of narrow\\nHαand H βin the spectrum) implies an attenuation A v=0.67±0.13 mag for the narrow-line region (Onoue\\net al., in prep), consistent with the median extinction value of our prior. We also note that for J2236+0032,\\nthe contribution of the host in the spectrum (Onoue et al., in prep) has a magnitude in close agreement\\nwith the NIRCam photometry, supporting our stellar mass estimate.\\nWe use gsf39to perform the SED model fitting. This software generates a set of templates with\\na range of ages and metallicities according to the prior to fit a composite stellar population (CSP)-like\\nstar formation history. A random parameter sampling is performed through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo\\n(MCMC) to infer the probability distribution of the SED parameters.

In Extended Data Figure 5, we present the best-fit SEDs of the two quasar hosts,\\nin which the MCMC inference indicates that the stellar mass is mildly sensitive to age and metallicity but\\nis more sensitive to A v. We also adopt the same configuration for the independent code Bagpipes40\\nandCIGALE41to perform SED fits; we find values of M ∗that change by 0.1 dex or less. The robust\\nmeasurement of stellar mass is due to having photometry on both sides of the 4000 Å break, accurate\\nspectroscopic redshifts, and a firm upper limit of the stellar age 0.84 Gyr, given the age of the universe at\\nz=6.4. Even so, we note that additional systematic uncertainties may be unaccounted for thus leading to\\ngreater uncertainty in the mass estimates than we have quoted.\\nNIRSpec Observations and data reduction\\nThe NIRSpec Fixed-Slit data for the two quasars were obtained on October 30, 2022 for J2236+0032 and\\nOctober 28, 2022 for J2255+0251.

The 1/fnoise along the vertical direction\\nwas subtracted from the Stage 1 products using the same method as that for NIRCam images. Pixels\\nof the science frames flagged as bad or saturated were masked based on the associated Data Quality\\nframes. During the Stage 2 data processing, including flat-fielding and flux calibration, we use in-flight\\nmeasurements of spectrophotometric standard stars ( jwst_nirspec_fflat_0065.fits ) to convert the detector\\nsignals into physical units. The signal loss due to the optical system and the finite width of the S200A2\\nslit were corrected in the Pathloss step by applying built-in correction factors for a point source as a\\nfunction of wavelength. The two-dimensional spectra at each dither position were then stacked using\\nthe Stage 3 pipeline. The pixel resampling scale was kept to the original pixel scale of the detector. A\\n6-pixel-wide box-car aperture (0 .′′6 wide) was employed to extract the one-dimensional spectrum from the\\nstacked spectrum.\\nSpectrum fitting\\nWe use a public code QSOFitMORE42(version 1.2.03) with custom modification to fit the NIRSpec\\nrest-optical spectra of the two quasars. The continuum emission is fitted with two components: power-law\\nemission from the accretion disk, and a pseudo-continuum from the forest of singly-ionized iron emission.\\nQSOFitMORE uses an empirical iron template of ref. 43. The rest-frame 5100 Å monochromatic\\nluminosity ( L5100) is derived from the best-fit power-law continuum model with a power-law index of αλ\\n(i.e., flux density Fλ∝λαλ).\\nEmission lines are modeled with a combination of one or more Gaussian profiles. J2236+0032 needs\\none broad component for H β, while the adjacent forbidden emission of [O III]λλ4960 ,5008 requires\\none narrow component and another blueshifted broad component. The narrow [O III] doublet is forced to\\nhave the same line width without velocity offsets between the two. The [O III] redshifts of the two targets\\nare derived from the peaks of the narrow [O III] components. The [O III] redshift of J2236+0032 agrees\\nwell with the location of the absorption lines we detect in H γ, Hδ, and H ε(Figure 3). The H β+[O III] line\\nprofile as well as the continuum properties of J2236+0032 are reported in Extended Data Table 2. A full\\ndescription of the fitting procedure and other emission line properties will be presented in Onoue et al. (in\\nprep.).\\nBH mass estimates\\nThe central black hole masses M BHof the two quasars are measured by the single-epoch method using\\nbroad H βemission lines. Assuming that the broad H βemission traces the kinematics of the gas orbiting\\nin the vicinity of the SMBHs (the so-called broad-line-region), one can use the line width of H βas a proxy\\nof the rotation velocity of the broad-line-region gas. There is also an empirical correlation between the\\nrest-frame 5100 Å continuum luminosity ( L5100) and the radius from the SMBH to the broad-line-region\\ngas, which is observed by the reverberation mapping technique44. In this paper, we use the recipe provided\\nby ref. 16 to estimate the black hole mass:\\nMBH=106.91\\x12L5100\\n1044erg s−1\\x130.50\\x12FWHM Hβ\\n103km s−1\\x132\\nM⊙.

We report the derived BH properties in Extended Data Table 2.\\nWe estimate the host galaxy contribution to the rest-optical continua of the NIRSpec spectra, using the\\ndecomposed host galaxy images in the NIRCam’s F356W filter. Referring to the relative position angle\\nof the NIRCam and NIRSpec observations, we find that the stellar emission falling inside the 0.′′2×0.′′6\\nextraction aperture is 21.8% (J2236+0032) and 4.8% (J2255+0251) with respect to the total emission.\\nWe interpret this as the fraction of the host starlight in the observed continuum emission in the NIRSpec\\nG395M spectrum for each source, which allows us to correct the 5100 Å continuum luminosity to that from\\nthe quasar emission alone. Accordingly, the virial BH masses become M BH= (1.36±0.15)×109M⊙\\nfor J2236+0032 and M BH= (1.97±0.17)×108M⊙for J2255+0251, respectively. These corrected BH\\nproperties are reported in Extended Data Table 2, and are adopted in Figure 4. This correction is more\\nsignificant for J2236+0032, in which stellar absorption lines are detected (Figure 3).\\nEmission from H β+[O III] in the hosts\\nOur SED model allows for the inclusion of the H β+[O III] line emission that falls within the F365W filter\\n(Extended Data Figure 5). However, if those lines were of high equivalent width in the hosts, they could\\naffect the broad-band photometry used in the stellar mass inference, especially if the gas is ionized by\\nthe quasar45,46. To ensure that our NIRCam detection of extended host emission is not dominated by\\nthese lines, we directly compare the total flux of the H β+[O III] narrow lines seen in our spectra with the\\ncontribution from the host in the NIRCam image within the aperture of the spectral slit. For J2236+0032,\\nnarrow H βemission is not detected and the [O III] emission in NIRSpec contributes only ∼3%of the\\nhost galaxy light.\\nFor J2255+0251, the narrow H β+[O III] emission is comparable to the host galaxy brightness measured\\nin the F356W filter. Much of this emission may be coming from the narrow-line region of the quasar itself.\\nTo quantify the impact on the detection of the stellar continuum, we use the 2D NIRSpec spectroscopic\\ndata and fit a Gaussian to the unresolved spatial profile at each wavelength, allowing the centroid to\\nvary linearly with wavelength, setting the width to be the same as the spatial PSF as measured from a\\npublicly available reference star in the same spectroscopic configuration as our observations, and letting\\nthe amplitude be a free parameter. The best-fit Gaussian profile at each wavelength is then subtracted\\nfrom the 2D spectrogram to reveal any spatially extended [O III] emission in the spectrum. A background\\nregion of equivalent size is subtracted from the extended emission region. We calculate the flux density of\\nthe extended emission in the F356W band and compare it to the flux density of the NIRCam host galaxy\\nwithin the aperture of the NIRSpec slit on the sky. For J2255+0251, the [O III] extended emission has a\\nmagnitude of 27.6, which is 11% of the flux of the observed host galaxy within the slit aperture. Note that\\nthe measurement of the extended emission is based on the observational fact that the apparent minor axis\\nof J2255+0251 is wider than the scale of the PSF in F356W (see Figure 2). We thus conclude that the\\nmajority of the narrow H β+[O III] emission in J2255+0251 comes from the unresolved quasar, which has\\nbeen removed by our quasar decomposition. For J2236+0032, we use the same approach and find that the\\nextended [O III] has a magnitude of 27.5 mag. The flux ratio between the extended [O III] and the host\\ngalaxy within the slit is ∼3%. No extended H βemission was detected in either target.\\nConstruction of mock quasar and host galaxy sample at z =6.4\\nWe use the method described in ref. 17to generate mock samples to assess the expected location of our', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf3.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

Introduction\\nQuasars, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in general, are powered by accretion onto the\\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of their host galaxies. Quasars are the most\\nluminous non-transient sources in the Universe, and have been observed up to a redshift\\nofz∼7.6 (Wang et al. 2021b). SMBH activities are a key ingredient of galaxy formation.\\nQuasars provide crucial probes of galaxy evolution and cosmology across cosmic history at\\nthree critical spatial scales:\\n1. At the scale of the AGN central engine ( <1pc), quasar emission originates from well\\nwithin the SMBH sphere of inﬂuence, at which the gravitational inﬂuence of the BH\\ndominates. Quasars are fundamental in understanding the physics of BH accretion\\nand growth and the physics of AGN activity.\\n2. At the scale of quasar host galaxies ( ∼1−10 kpc), the evolution of quasars and\\ngalaxies are strongly coupled, as shown by the tight correlation between SMBH mass', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

At the scale of galaxy clusters and superclusters ( >Mpc), quasars can be used to\\nprobe the growth of early large scale structure. They also provide sightlines to study\\nthe properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM), including the history of cosmic\\nreionization, the chemical enrichment of the IGM, the distribution of baryons and\\nthe evolution of ionization state of the IGM, and its connection to galaxy formation\\nthrough the circumgalactic medium (CGM).\\nThe history of quasar studies is driven and shaped by innovations in systematic surveys\\nand multiwavelength observations of quasars. These observations aim to reaching higher\\nredshift, covering the full range of quasar luminosities, and spatially resolving quasar hosts\\nand their central AGN structure. Studies of high-redshift quasars within the ﬁrst few billion\\nyears of cosmic history started with the advent of large area digital or digitized sky surveys,\\nhighlighted by progress made using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York\\net al. 2000), which resulted in the ﬁrst detections of quasars at z>5 andz>6 (Fan et al.\\n2001). Observations of z∼6 quasars in the early 2000s provided fundamental insights in\\nthe three key scales of galaxy evolution mentioned above:\\n1. SMBHs with masses up to a few billion M⊙already existed in the Universe within\\none billion years after the Big Bang, requiring a combination of early massive BH\\nseeds and rapid BH accretion.\\n2. Early luminous quasars are sites of intensive galaxy-scale star formation and the\\nassembly of early massive galaxies.\\n3. Detection of strong IGM absorption in quasar spectra, especially the emergence of\\ncomplete Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs (Gunn & Peterson 1965) shows a rapid\\ntransition of the ionization state of the IGM at z∼5−6, marking this epoch as the\\nend of cosmic reionization.\\nIn this review, we will focus on the progress since then, including the quests for the\\nearliest quasars, and the detailed studies of quasars during and right after the epoch of\\nreionization (EoR). We will limit our discussions to: (1) the redshift range of z > 5.3;\\nthis is the lower redshift limit at which there are still detectable signatures of reionization\\nactivity. This redshift corresponds to 1.1 Gyr after the Big Bang, when the Universe was at\\n8% of its current age. We consider z>5.3 as “cosmic dawn” in the context of this review.\\n(2) Luminous Type-1 quasars, for which secure spectroscopic observations and systematic\\nsurveys are currently possible. (3) IGM studies using quasar absorption spectra; we will\\nnot discuss other probes of EoR in detail. This review will focus mainly on observations,\\nand we will discuss theories and simulations largely in the context of understanding and\\npredicting observations.\\nAt the time of this review, JWST has started routine observations, and initial JWST\\nresults have begun to appear in the literature. We will not include any early JWST results\\nin this article. JWST observations of high-redshift quasars will undoubtedly provide many\\nnew insights that will result in discoveries and challenges that should be the subject of a\\nfuture review.\\nThere have been a number of excellent Annual Review articles on related topics which\\nwe will not repeat: Inayoshi et al. (2020) reviewed topics related to the initial BH seeds and\\nearly growth; Kormendy & Ho (2013) presented a very detailed discussion of BH/galaxy co-\\nevolution; Carilli & Walter (2013) reviewed early (pre-ALMA) sub/mm observations of high-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 3', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

In this Section, we will present a database of all published\\nType-1 quasars at z > 5.3.

We will also\\nhighlight special populations of high-redshift quasars. In Section 4, we will discuss the use\\nof high-redshift quasars as probes to the history of SMBH growth in the early Universe,\\nand review statistics of measurements of quasar BH masses and accretion characteristics.\\nIn Section 5, we will review the observations of quasar host galaxies from the rest-frame UV\\nto far-IR, in the context of the co-evolution of early SMBH growth and galaxy formation,\\nand the roles quasar played in early galaxy and structure formation. In Section 6, we\\nwill review the the progress in using IGM absorption in quasar sight lines and properties\\nof quasar proximity zones to probe the history of cosmic reionization and IGM chemical\\nenrichment.

THE QUASAR REDSHIFT FRONTIER\\nAdvances in the studies of high-redshift quasars are ﬁrst and foremost driven by advances in\\nhigh-redshift quasar surveys and new discoveries. The quasar redshift frontier continues to\\nexpand as a result of new sky surveys: the ﬁrst quasar discoveries at z>4 in the 1980s were\\nmade possible by digital or digitized large sky surveys and the ﬁrst implementations of color\\ndrop-out selection techniques (e.g., Warren et al. 1987). After the SDSS discoveries of the\\nﬁrstz>5 (Fan et al. 1999) and z>6 (Fan et al. 2001) quasars in the early 2000s, wide-ﬁeld\\nnear-infrared (NIR) sky surveys in the following decade, such as UKIDSS (Lawrence et al.\\n2007) led to the detection of the ﬁrst quasars at z >7 (e.g., Mortlock et al. 2011), deep\\ninto the EoR. At the time of this review, the quasar redshift frontier stands at z= 7.64\\n(Wang et al. 2021b). Meanwhile, increasingly large samples of high-redshift quasars are\\nestablished by continued mining and systematic spectroscopic followup observations based\\non these new surveys. Currently, about 1000 quasars have been discovered at z >5, and\\nmore than 200 at z>6.\\n2.1. Progress in High-Redshift Quasar Surveys\\nSurveys of the highest redshift quasars face three technical challenges. First, quasars at\\ncosmic dawn are among the rarest objects in the Universe. The ﬁnal SDSS z∼6 quasar\\nsample covers more than 11,000 deg2, but contains only 52 quasars (Jiang et al. 2016).\\nTheir discoveries require large surveys that cover a signiﬁcant fraction of the sky. The\\nsecond challenge is often referred to as “ﬁnding needles in a haystack”. Most high-redshift\\nquasar surveys are based on Lyman break dropout selections using optical and NIR pho-\\ntometric survey data. However, other populations of celestial objects, in particular cool\\ngalactic dwarfs with spectral types M, L and T (usually referred as MLTs) and compact\\n4 Fan et al.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Barnett et al.\\n(2019) show that these contaminant populations outnumber z∼7 quasars by 2–4 orders of\\nmagnitude in deep photometric surveys. A number of photometric selection techniques have\\nbeen developed, and the choices of how to apply these techniques require careful consider-\\nation of the balance between selection eﬃciency and completeness.

As shown in Fig 2, at z >7,\\nquasars begin to drop out in the yband at the red limit of CCD detector sensitivities.\\nThe discovery of quasars at this redshift requires the combination of wide-ﬁeld IR surveys\\nthat provide detection of the quasar rest-frame UV continuum, and deep optical surveys\\nthat sample the strong Lyman break. Following the ﬁrst quasar discovery at z >7 using\\nphotometric data from the UKIDSS survey (Mortlock et al. 2011), there have been eight\\nquasars published at z >7 (see Table 1). The current redshift frontier is represented by\\nthe three luminous quasars known at z>7.5, selected using a combination of NIR, optical,\\nand MIR (WISE) surveys: J1342+0928 at z= 7.54 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2018); J1007+2115\\natz= 7.52 (“P¯ oniu¯ a’ena”, Yang et al. 2020b); and J0313-1806 at z= 7.64 (Wang et al.\\n2021b).\\n2.2. Optimization of Photometric Selection of High-Redshift Quasars\\nThe vast majority of high-redshift quasars have been discovered using color selection. The\\nmost commonly used method is to implement a series of “color cuts”: select objects that\\nmeet a set of criteria in the ﬂux/ﬂux-error space (usually referred to as the “color space”) as\\nhigh-redshift quasar candidates. These cuts are often initially guided by a combination of\\nphotometry of existing high-redshift quasars and simulated colors based on synthetic quasar\\nspectra, as well as observed and simulated data of the contaminant populations. These cuts\\nare reﬁned as surveys progress with larger training sets and better understanding of the\\ncontaminant populations. Fan (1999) presented an early example of color space simulation\\nof diﬀerent populations of objects with compact morphology (quasars, normal stars, white\\ndwarfs and compact galaxies) in the SDSS photometric system. This simulation was used\\nto formulate color selections for both the SDSS main spectroscopic survey (Richards et al.\\n2002) and selections of z∼6 quasars (Fan et al. 2001). Works such as Hewett et al. (2006),\\nMcGreer et al. (2013), Barnett et al. (2019), and Temple et al. (2021) expanded these\\nsimulations by including more realistic quasar population models and models of MLT and\\nintermediate-redshift galaxies, extending to higher redshifts, and including NIR and MIR\\nphotometric bands.\\nHigh-redshift surveys based on SDSS (e.g., Jiang et al. 2016), PS1 (e.g., Ba˜ nados et al.\\n2016) as well as works using the DESI Legacy Survey (e.g., Wang et al. 2019) used color\\ncuts as their primary selection method. The color cut method is simple to implement, and\\nhas high selection completeness even for objects that have unusual spectral features such\\nas broad absorption lines (BALs), weak emission lines or those with modest reddening,\\nbecause the color cuts are usually fairly loose and cover a large portion of color space, and\\nthe strong Lyman break is not strongly aﬀected by the intrinsic quasar SEDs. On the\\nother hand, because all candidates that satisfy the cuts are selected without considering\\nthe relative density distribution of the targeted (quasar) population and the contaminant\\npopulations (primary MLTs and compact galaxies), or how the candidate SEDs match the\\nquasar template, color cut selection tends to have a higher contamination rate. For example,\\nWang et al. (2019) ﬁnd a 30% spectroscopic success rate when searching for z>6.5 quasars.\\nThe contamination grows signiﬁcantly worse for z∼7.5 (F. Wang, private communication).\\nA number of techniques have been applied to improve the eﬃciency of color selection.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 7', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='These improvements are especially important for quasars at the highest redshift ( z>6.5),\\nwhere quasars are increasingly rare compared to the contaminant populations, and at fainter\\nﬂuxes for which increasing photometric errors results in more contaminants scatter into the\\nselected area in color space. Mortlock et al. (2012) ﬁrst introduced a selection algorithm\\nbased on Bayesian model comparison (BMC).

They show that BMC\\nis highly complete in recovering previously known quasars in the survey area, and at the\\nsame time eﬀectively rejects conﬁrmed contaminants. Using simulations, they calculate the\\nsurvey selection function – completeness as a function of quasar redshift and luminosity, and\\nﬁnd that both BMC and the SED method represent a signiﬁcant improvement in selection\\ncompleteness and depth compared to simple color cuts.\\nWenzl et al. (2021) used a random forest supervised machine learning method to select\\nz>5 quasars from PS1 data with high eﬃciency. Nanni et al.

The training sets of existing objects are small, and in most case are subject\\nto the bias of previously selected samples or extrapolations from low-redshift populations.\\nThe choice of high-redshift quasar selection algorithm in a given survey is a tradeoﬀ be-\\ntween completeness and eﬃciency. Selections that rely on SED and contaminant population\\nmodels run the risk of missing objects that are highly valuable but have unusual properties.\\nAn example is the discovery of J0100+2802, the most luminous unlensed quasar currently\\nknown atz >5 (Wu et al. 2015). The object was assigned as low priority in the original\\nSDSS survey due to its relatively red color and bright apparently magnitude, indicating\\nhigh probability of it being a brown dwarf.

Except for the last method (e.g., Schneider et al.\\n1989, 1999), most selection methods are not sensitive to the quasar redshifts.

Future Quasar Surveys\\nNew surveys are on the horizon to further expand the quasar redshift frontier. The Legacy\\nSurvey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will cover the southern\\nsky at optical wavelengths to unprecedented depths. LSST will reach 5 σco-added depths in\\nthezandybands at 25−26 mag level in 5-10 years (Ivezi´ c et al. 2019), allowing selections of\\nseveral thousand quasars and AGN at z∼6−7.5 using both color and variablity selection\\nmethods, while providing deep photometry in the dropout bands for selection of z > 7\\nquasars. ESA’s Euclid mission will provide deep near-IR photometry not possible with\\nground-based observations. It will cover 15,000 deg2of the sky to a 5 σdepth of 24 mag in\\nY, J and H bands (Scaramella et al. 2022), enabling selection of quasar candidates up to\\nz∼10. Barnett et al. (2019) predicted that Euclid + LSST will allow discoveries of ∼25\\nquasars atz>7.5, including∼8 beyondz>8, although the exact yields strongly depend\\non the assumed evolution of quasar luminosity function. Further in the future is NASA’s\\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will cover a smaller area in its High Latitude\\nSurvey but reaching about two magnitude deeper.\\nFan et al. (2019a) show that by extrapolating the current measurement of the quasar\\nluminosity function, there will be only one “SDSS”-like quasar ( M1450<−26, powered by\\nbillion-M⊙SMBH) over the entire observable universe at z>9. The combination of LSST,\\nEuclid and Roman will allow the discovery of the earliest luminous quasars in the Universe.\\nHowever, in addition to the challenges of their selection (Barnett et al. 2019, Nanni et al.\\n2022), their spectroscopic identiﬁcation will require IR spectrographs more powerful than\\nthose with the current ground-based telescopes: 30m-class extremely large telescopes and\\nJWST will be the primary tools for their conﬁrmation and follow-up observations.\\n3. AN EVOLVING QUASAR POPULATION\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst review the evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at high\\nredshift, which directly constrains the growth history of early SMBHs (Sec 3.1). The number\\ndensity of quasars is found to decline rapidly towards high redshift, in sharp constrast to\\nthe lack of strong evolution in the SEDs of quasars (Sec 3.2), from X-ray to radio, and in\\nparticular in the rest-frame UV to NIR, at which the quasar SED peaks, although a number\\nof sub-types of quasars appear to be more common at z>5−6.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 11', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

Evolution of Quasar Luminosity Function\\nSoon after the initial discovery of quasars, Schmidt (1968) found that their density rises\\nsharply with redshift up to z≳2.

Based on a sample of nine SDSS quasars at z >5.7, Fan et al. (2004) found that\\natz∼6, the co-moving spatial density of quasars with M1450<−26.7 is 6×10−10Mpc−3,\\nconsistent with extrapolation from lower redshift trends. Jiang et al. (2009) extended the\\nSDSS quasar survey to the “stripe 82” region, reaching two magnitudes deeper than the\\nSDSS main survey. They found a bright end slope βbetween –2.6 and –3.1. Willott et al.\\n(2010) combined the faint quasars discovered in the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey\\n(CFHQS) with the brighter SDSS quasars, and presented the ﬁrst measurement of QLF at\\nz∼6 using a sample of 40 quasars. They found a bright end slope β=−2.81 and a break\\nmagnitude M∗\\n1450=−25.1; the faint end slope was still poorly constrained at this redshift.\\nJiang et al.

In addition, they found a density evolution with the exponential evolution\\nparameter k=−0.72±0.11, a signiﬁcantly steeper slope than the value at z∼3−5,\\nsuggesting an accelerated evolution of luminous quasars between z∼5 and 6.\\nThe SHELLQs project (Matsuoka et al. 2016) extended the z∼6 quasar sample to\\nsigniﬁcantly lower luminosity. Matsuoka et al.

Their measured QLF showed a strong break and a signiﬁcant ﬂattening at\\nthe faint end at z∼6. Schindler et al. (2022) used the combination of the bright PS1\\nquasar sample that includes 125 quasars at z∼5.7−6.2 with the fainter quasars from\\nSHELLQs for a new QLF measurement at z∼6. They found a steeper bright-end slope\\nofβ=−3.84+0.63\\n−1.21, as well as a steeper faint-end slope of α=−1.70+0.29\\n−0.19, with a bright\\nbreak magnitude of M∗\\n1450=−26.38+0.79\\n−0.60.

(A Lack of) Evolution of the Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions\\nHigh-redshift galaxies have intrinsic blue SEDs that are dominated by young stellar popu-\\nlations. Metallicity, or chemical abundance, in their ISM has also been shown to be lower\\nthan in low-redshift galaxies (Stark 2016). However, the overall SEDs and the chemical\\nabundance in quasar broad line regions (BLRs) do not evolve signiﬁcantly with redshift, al-\\nthough quasar density decreases drastically at high-redshift. This apparent lack of spectral\\nevolution in the UV properties of quasars were noticed as soon as the ﬁrst z∼6 quasars\\nwere discovered (e.g., Barth et al. 2003, Fan et al. 2004, Iwamuro et al. 2004, Jiang et al.\\n2007). Shen et al. (2019) conducted an optical/NIR spectroscopic survey of 50 quasars at\\nz >5.7. Their observations covered the wavelength range from the Ly αto Mg iiemission\\nlines. Yang et al. (2021) presented a spectroscopic survey of 34 quasars at 6 .3< z < 7.6,\\ncovering a similar wavelength range. Both papers presented composite rest-frame UV spec-\\ntra of their high-redshift samples. Fig 5 compares the quasar composite spectra at z∼6−7\\nwith the standard low-redshift SDSS quasar composite from Vanden Berk et al. (2001). The\\naverage continuum slope and emission line strength/width do not evolve signiﬁcantly with\\nredshift, with the exception of a weaker and blueshifted C ivemission line (see discussion\\nin Sec 5.4).\\nBroad emission line ratios in quasars have been used to constrain metallicities in the\\nquasar BLR. Jiang et al. (2007) and De Rosa et al.

Schindler et al. (2020) carried out detailed modeling of Fe iiand\\nMgiilines using a large sample of quasar spectra from VLT/Xshooter, and compared their\\nmeasurements with those in the literature. There is no evidence of evolution in the Fe/Mg\\nratio up to the highest redshift, although scatter is large at any given redshift (Fig 5). The\\nlack of spectral evolution in quasar rest-frame UV spectra, especially in the emission line\\nproperties, indicates that quasar BLRs are chemically enriched very rapidly, within the ﬁrst\\nfew hundred million years after the initial star formation in the host galaxy. This is not\\nsurprising, as we will review in Sec 5: quasar host galaxies are sites of the most intense star\\nformation in the early universe.\\nHowever, there are a few noticeable evolutionary trends in quasars at cosmic dawn that\\ncould be related to the early phase of quasar growth. In Sec 5.4, we discuss an increasing\\nfraction of quasars with strongly blue-shifted high ionization UV emission lines and with\\nstrong BAL features as evidence for early quasar feedback.

Yang et al.\\n(2021) studied 37 quasars at z>6.3 and found that these quasars have signiﬁcantly higher\\nEddington ratios (mean of 1.08 and median 0.85) than a luminosity-matched quasar sample\\nat low redshift. Farina et al. (2022) studied the NIR spectra of 135 z≳5.7 quasars (including\\nBH properties derived from Mg iiand C iv), ﬁnding that at z∼6 the Eddington ratio\\ndistributions are consistent with a luminosity-matched low-redshift sample independent of\\nthe luminosity, while there is evidence for a mild increase in the median Eddington ratios\\nforz≳6.5 (in agreement with Yang et al. 2021).\\nIn our current compilation (Fig. 6), the Eddington ratio ranges from 0 .08 to 2.70, with a\\nmedian of 0.79 and a mean of 0.92.

When and how\\nthese tight correlations arose is an open question. Constraints at the highest redshifts can\\nprovide essential clues when the time to grow a galaxy and BH is limited. Did the BH grow\\nﬁrst, and the galaxy follow? Vice versa? Or did they grow together? What are the main\\nfeedback mechanisms? How are the massive galaxies hosting quasars connected to their\\nlarge-scale environment?\\nIn this section, we will ﬁrst review the current eﬀorts to detect the gas reservoirs required\\nfor the growth of the central SMBH and the formation of stars (Section 5.1). We will then\\ngive an overview of the eﬀorts to measure the stellar UV light from the z>6 quasar hosts\\nand the recent successes in constraining their cold dust and gas via (sub)mm observations\\n(Section 5.2). We will then discuss how we can use this information to constrain BH/galaxy\\nco-evolution (Section 4.3) and describe observational evidence (or lack of) quasar feedback\\n(Section 5.4). Finally, we will give an overview of the eﬀorts for using z≳6 quasars as\\nsignposts for overdensities and large-scale structure in the early Universe (Section 5.5).\\n5.1. Quasar fueling - Ly αnebuale\\nEnormous gas reservoirs are required to grow the SMBHs seen in the highest-redshift quasars\\ncontinuously.

In principle, such gas reservoirs are likely also\\nstar-forming regions (Haiman & Rees 2001, Di Matteo et al. 2017). The ﬁrst eﬀorts to look\\nfor these nebulae used narrow-band ﬁlters centered on the expected Ly αemission (e.g., Goto\\net al. 2009, Decarli et al. 2012, Momose et al. 2019) and through deep long-slit spectroscopy\\n(e.g., Willott et al. 2011, Roche et al. 2014).

The most\\ncomprehensive search for Ly αhalos to date is the REQUIEM survey (Farina et al. 2019),\\ntargeting 31 z >5.7 quasars with VLT/MUSE. REQUIEM revealed 12 Ly αnebulae with\\na range of luminosities and morphologies extending up to 30 kpc.

This result might imply that the observed\\nLyαhalos are being powered by the central SMBH instead of tracing star formation, in\\nline with recent simulations (Costa et al. 2022). Nevertheless, the resonant nature of the\\nLyαline makes it diﬃcult to disentangle the AGN/star-formation contribution completely.\\nIFS observations of additional non-resonant lines (e.g., H αwith JWST) will be needed to\\nconﬁrm these results.\\n5.2.

(2010) measured dynamical masses using CO emission from 8 quasar hosts\\natz∼6. Assuming an average inclination angle of 40◦andR= 2.5 kpc, they found that the\\nz∼6 quasars have, on average, SMBHs a factor 15 more massive than expected from the\\nlocal BH – bulge mass relation. This result suggests that BHs in high redshift quasars either\\ngot a major head-start or grew faster than their host galaxies; if the M- σrelation existed\\natz∼6, would show a strong cosmic evolution. Numerous subsequent works have focused\\non the correlation of SMBH mass and galaxy dynamical mass at these redshifts (e.g., Wang\\net al. 2016, Decarli et al. 2018).

Evidence of Quasar Feedback\\nCentral accreting SMBHs play an important role in shaping galaxy evolution (see review\\nby Fabian 2012). Indeed, to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxy masses at z= 0,\\nsimulations require that strong AGN feedback was already in place at z∼6 (e.g., Kaviraj\\net al. 2017). Below we list some of the observational evidence (with caveats) that these\\nfeedback mechanisms are taking place in the z≳6 quasar population:\\nUV Line Shifts. High-redshift quasars show asymmetric shape and velocity oﬀset of\\nhigh ionization lines, in particular the C ivline. The low-redshift quasar population shows\\nan overall blueshifted C ivline (∼800 km s−1) compared to the systemic redshift of the\\nquasar (e.g., traced by H β, Shen et al. 2011). This shift is generally understood in the\\ncontext of a strong accretion disk wind that contributes to the high-ionization lines (e.g.,\\nRichards et al. 2011). At z >6, the C ivline velocity shift is much stronger ( ∼1800 km\\ns−1, Schindler et al. 2020). Meyer et al. (2019) suggested that this redshift evolution can be\\nexplained by the C ivwinds being launched from the disk with an increased torus opacity\\nat this redshift.\\nBAL Quasars. A fraction of quasars show broad and highly blue-shifted absorption\\nfeatures in their rest-frame UV transitions. BAL features trace ionized winds in the broad\\nline region and are recognized signatures of SMBH feedback. Bischetti et al. (2022) used\\nhigh-quality spectra of quasars from the XQR30 survey to show that up to ∼50% of\\nluminous quasars at z∼6 exhibit BAL features (with outﬂow velocities up to 17% of\\nthe speed of light), compared to about 20% observed in low-redshift samples. Yang et al.\\n(2021) studied 37 quasars at 6 .3<z< 7.64 and reported a BAL fraction of ∼24%, smaller\\nthan the Bischetti et al. (2022) work but still slightly larger than what is observed at lower\\nredshifts. This potential evolution of the BAL fraction could be a result of the strong\\nfeedback associated with the rapid BH growth and galaxy assembly in the early Universe.\\nLyαhalos. The existence of extended Ly αnebulae around z≳6 quasars was discussed\\nin Section 5.1. Recently, Costa et al. (2022) performed a suite of cosmological, radiation-\\nhydrodynamic simulations to understand the origin and properties of the observed Ly α\\nhalos. The simulations unambiguously require quasar-powered outﬂows to match the ob-\\nserved properties at z≳6, providing indirect evidence for AGN feedback.\\nRadio jets . Only six galaxies hosting radio-loud quasars at z≳6 have been studied with\\nALMA and NOEMA (Rojas-Ruiz et al. 2021, Khusanova et al. 2022). Assuming no AGN\\ncontribution, their, their [C ii]- and FIR-derived star-formation properties are consistent\\nwith those reported for the much more studied radio-quiet quasars (c.f., Decarli et al. 2018,\\nVenemans et al. 2020; see Fig. 8). However, Rojas-Ruiz et al. (2021) and Khusanova et al.\\n(2022) show indirect evidence that the FIR emission of radio-loud quasars can be strongly\\naﬀected by synchrotron emission. In that case, their IR-derived star formation rates can\\nbe overestimated, implying that we might be witnessing negative AGN feedback at z >6.\\nHowever, more measurements of the FIR continuum and/or an enlarged sample are required\\nto quantify the potential impact on the population.\\n28 Fan et al.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

These limitations arise from multiple sources,\\nbut the most signiﬁcant factors discussed below are (a) uncertainty in the quasar’s in-\\ntrinsic/unabsorbed spectral continuum, (b) the large on-resonance oscillator strength of\\nHiLyα, which leads to a wide gap in sensitivity between neutral fractions of XHi∼10−4\\n(where resonance absorption saturates) and ∼10−1(where damping wings appear), and\\n(c) computational challenges of simulating representative volumes with inhomogeneous and\\nrapidly evolving radiation ﬁelds.\\n6.1. AGN and the Ionizing Photon Budget\\nQuasar accretion produces a hard ionizing spectrum, making the AGN population a con-\\ntributing source to the budget of photons needed for reionization. However as detailed in\\nthe recent review by Robertson (2021) and references therein, there is an emerging con-\\nsensus that AGN play a subdominant role compared to galaxies as an overall driver of the\\nphase transition, even when one extrapolates observed luminosity functions to thresholds\\nfainter than current detection limits. Jiang et al. (2022) further reinforced this conclusion\\nby placing an upper limit on the contributions of low luminosity AGN to reionization us-\\ning deep HST survey data. Finkelstein & Bagley (2022) have synthesized measurements\\nacross the lierature of galaxy+AGN UV luminosity functions, to estimate their relative\\ncontributions to the ionizing photon budget, using strong assumptions about the ionizing\\nradiation escape fractions of each population. They estimate that AGN supply ∼10% of\\nthe total ionizing photon budget at z∼5, roughly the lower limit of redshifts considered in\\nour review. They found that this fraction drops rapidly toward higher redshift because of\\ndiﬀerential downward evolution in the quasar luminosity function relative to galaxies. By\\nz∼7 they estimate that AGN contribute only 0 .3−1.0% of all ionizing photons, declining\\nby yet another order of magnitude by z∼9. In contrast, Giallongo et al. (2019) suggested\\nthat AGN contributions to the UV background can still be signiﬁcant at z∼5.6 based on\\nX-ray selected objects.\\nThe quantitative uncertainties in these analyses are still considerable; Finkelstein et al.\\n(2019) found a 10 ×higher contribution from AGN at z∼7 using diﬀerent assumptions.\\nMuch of this may be attributed to uncertainties in the faint end slope of the quasar lu-\\nminosity function. Still, the qualitative picture that reionization is heavily dominated by\\nstar-forming galaxies appears to remain fairly robust with respect to these uncertainties.\\nThe fractional contribution of quasars and AGN increases toward lower redshift because of\\ntheir rapidly rising number densities, such that they are more likely to dominate the meta-\\ngalactic UV background in the at z <4 post-reionization universe. New surveys with the\\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and JWST should revolutionize this ﬁeld, providing\\nboth deep, near-IR color selected objects deep into the EoR, and also sensitive spectra to\\nconﬁrm the AGN nature of faint candidates and separate them from star-forming galaxies.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 31', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",

Fig 14 presents a summary of proximity zone size measurements, along with “young\\nquasars” identiﬁed through this type of measurement.\\nIf this interpretation is correct, then proximity zone size distributions can be used to\\nconstrain the UV duty cycle of early quasars. The size is sensitive only to the age of the most\\nrecent or current UV-bright episode, which is not necessarily the ﬁrst in its history. However\\nthe growth timescale problem for building SMBHs at z >6 is well known (see Sec 4; and\\nVolonteri 2010), and this challenge is only exacerbated for any accretion duty cycle below\\nunity.

IGM Damping Wings. As one penetrates deeper into the reionization epoch near\\nz∼7, the ambient neutral fraction increases and the corresponding length scale of proximity\\nzones becomes smaller. When the neutral fraction approaches 1–10%, the eﬀects of oﬀ-\\nresonance Ly αdamping wings become signiﬁcant (Miralda-Escud´ e 1998). Details of this\\nprocess have been reviewed in Mortlock (2016). Brieﬂy, high column densities of neutral\\nhydrogen in the nearby foreground of a quasar lead to a non-negligible probability that a\\nphoton emitted redward of Ly αin the quasar’s rest frame will still be absorbed by neutral\\nintergalactic matter en route to Earth. This last fact is critical—in the far-foreground Ly α\\nforest region there is an unresolvable degeneracy at any wavelength between oﬀ-resonance\\ndamping wing absorption from neutral gas, and on-resonance absorption from ionized gas\\nat a diﬀerent redshift. In contrast, absorption redward of the Ly αemission line can only\\ncome from oﬀ-resonance interactions.\\nThe IGM damping signature is expected around quasars meeting two conditions: they\\nhave recently turned on, and are embedded in an IGM with high global neutral fraction.\\nIn contrast to z∼6 proximity zones that have already been pre-ionized by surrounding\\ngalaxies, the z∼7 quasars with damping wings are driving true ionization fronts into the\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 41', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",

This combination of small proximity zone and damping wing has not\\nbeen measured in a single quasar at z <7, despite the much larger sample sizes available\\nfor testing.\\nBecause most of the damping wing is generated just outside the ionized bubble, there\\nis a risk that the same signature could arise from chance alignment of a classical damped\\nLyαabsorber (i.e. from the ISM of a bound proto-galaxy) near the quasar in an otherwise\\nionized IGM (Section 6.5).

The a priori odds of such a chance alignment are\\nsmall, but were considered carefully in studies of the ﬁrst damping wing (Simcoe et al.\\n2012). There are two arguments now suggesting that this phenomenon is not aﬀecting IGM\\nmeasurements at z>7. First, none of the four sightlines listed above exhibit heavy-element\\nabsorption at the redshift of the putative DLA, to very sensitive limits. Second, the presence\\nof damping wings in multiple new z>7 discoveries points to a global phenomenon, as the\\njoint probability of seeing proximate DLAs in all of these becomes lower still. With very\\nhigh-SNR data it is in principle possible to distinguish between DLA absorption from the\\ncondensed CGM/ISM of a proto-galaxy and an extended patch of neutral but gravitationally\\nunbound IGM using the damping proﬁle alone. However no studies at present have claimed\\nsuch a detection.\\nA ﬁnal unknowable factor in damping wing analysis is the spatial distribution of gas\\ndensity and accompanying ﬂuctuations in ionization inside and outside the proximity zone.\\nEarly papers used analytic models based on distribution functions of overdensity, and as-\\nsumed that the gas was in ionization equilibrium with a uniform background radiation ﬁeld\\n(Mortlock et al. 2011, Simcoe et al. 2012).

The evolution of the number density of heavy\\nelement absorption systems is summarized in Fig 17.\\nThe observational disappearance of the ionized CGM implies that during this epoch\\nwhere galaxies are in early assembly, their circumgalactic gas has not yet been enriched to\\nobservable levels, and/or the ambient radiation ﬁeld is insuﬃcient in intensity or hardness to\\nmaintain a high degree of ionization. Unfortunately it is impossible to calculate abundances\\ndirectly at z > 6, because H icolumn density measurement is prevented by the Gunn-\\nPeterson trough.

If there exists a warm ionized\\nmedium of similar metallicity in pressure equilibrium with the warm neutral phase, it would\\nbe clearly detected in C iv. To evade detection, the ionized medium must have ∼100×lower\\nabundance, or [C/H] <−4 (Simcoe et al. 2020).

These “proximate\\nDLAs” have a special importance, and four have been discovered at z >6. They are the\\nonly discrete absorbers in the reionization epoch for which it is possible to constrain NHI\\ndirectly using the oﬀ-resonance wing.

Summary\\nSince the ﬁrst discoveries of reionization-era quasars more than twenty years ago, tremen-\\ndous progress has been made in extending the frontiers of quasar research deeper into the\\ncosmic dawn, in characterizing and understanding these objects in the context of early\\nSMBH growth and galaxy formation, and in using them as beacons to shed light on the\\nevolution of the IGM and the history of cosmic reionization.\\nSUMMARY POINTS\\n1. The current frontier of quasar research is at z∼7.6, with a large statistical sample\\nassembled at redshifts up to 7. High-redshift quasar selection is a challenging data\\nmining problem because of the rarity of the targets, the limited training sets, and\\nthe overwhelmingly large number of contaminant sources, both astrophysical and\\ninstrumental. We provide a database of the properties of all published quasars at\\nz>5.3 asSupplementary Material that accompanies this review.\\n2. The rapid evolution of the quasar LF has been well established. However, the\\nexact shape of the LF is still uncertain, both at the high luminosity end due to\\nsmall number statistics, and at the low luminosity end due to limitations of deep\\nsurveys. In sharp contrast, early quasars “look” almost identical to their low-\\nredshift counterparts in spectral properties. Even the earliest known quasars have\\na well-established AGN structure.\\n3. There are more than 100 z≳6 quasars with robust BH mass measurements. Their\\nmasses range from ∼4×107M⊙to∼1010M⊙. The BHs are growing at high Ed-\\ndington ratios ( λEﬀ,median = 0.79 andλEﬀ,mean = 0.92), with mild evidence of an\\nincrease of the accretion rate for z≳6.5 quasars in comparison to luminosity-\\nmatched quasar samples at lower redshifts.\\n4. The UV stellar light in z∼6 quasar hosts remains undetected, while on the other\\nhand, (sub)mm observations have revealed the existence of copious amounts of gas\\nand cold dust in many of these galaxies. Quasar hosts are massive, star-forming\\ngalaxies showing diverse morphology and kinematics; their average dynamical mass\\nappears lower than that based on the local scaling relation between BH and galaxy\\nmasses.\\n5. Lyαabsorption in quasars’ foreground IGM provides many of the most stringent\\nconstraints on the history of reionization, though the details of the observations\\nvary with redshift. Toward the end of reionization at z<6, counts of transmission\\n48 Fan et al.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",

With the new facilities planned for the next decade, we expect the quasar redshift\\nfrontier to reach redshift 9–10, when the ﬁrst generation of luminous quasars is\\nforming. A key challenge will be the spectroscopic conﬁrmation of these faint high-\\nredshift sources.\\n2. SMBH mass measurements using the H βline with JWST and gas-dynamical esti-\\nmates with ALMA (and eventually the ngVLA) will provide more accurate measure-\\nments than what is currently possible. These results will be crucial to test whether\\nthe current methods calibrated at low redshift (e.g., Mg iisingle-epoch virial mass)\\nstill hold at the highest accessible redshifts. To measure the BH masses of the pro-\\ngenitors of the currently observed z= 6−7 quasar population, NIR spectroscopic\\nfollow-up with the ELTs will be key.\\n3. JWST will likely be able to ﬁnally reveal stellar light from z≳6 quasar hosts.\\nALMA will continue playing a critical role in understanding and characterizing the\\ninterstellar medium of quasar host galaxies via multi-line diagnostics.\\n4. New quasar samples uncovered by Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope and\\nobserved with JWST and ELTs should substantially improve conﬁdence in z≥7\\nmeasurements of IGM damping wings. They will allow studies even deeper into the\\npast.\\n5. JWST already shows promise of being transformative for surveys of galaxies in ﬁelds\\nwhere high-redshift quasars have been used to constrain the IGM density ﬁeld. This\\nmay open the possibility of studying cross-correlations between Ly α, metals, and\\ngalaxies.\\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\\nThe authors are not aware of any aﬃliations, memberships, funding, or ﬁnancial holdings\\nthat might be perceived as aﬀecting the objectivity of this review.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 49', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",

While the near-infrared (NIR) variability of Sgr A* was shown to be consistent\\nover two decades, unprecedented activity in 2019 challenges existing statistical models. We investigate\\nthe origin of this activity by re-calibrating and re-analyzing all of our Keck Observatory Sgr A* imaging\\nobservations from 2005-2022. We present light curves from 69 observation epochs using the NIRC2\\nimager at 2.12 µm with laser guide star adaptive optics. These observations reveal that the mean\\nluminosity of Sgr A* increased by a factor of ∼3 in 2019, and the 2019 light curves had higher variance\\nthan in all time periods we examined. We find that the 2020-2022 flux distribution is statistically\\nconsistent with the historical sample and model predictions, but with fewer bright measurements\\nabove 0.6 mJy at the ∼2σlevel. Since 2019, we have observed a maximum Ks(2.2µm) flux of 0.9\\nmJy, compared to the highest pre-2019 flux of 2.0 mJy and highest 2019 flux of 5.6 mJy. Our results\\nsuggest that the 2019 activity was caused by a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr A*, possibly due\\nto delayed accretion of tidally-stripped gas from the gaseous object G2 in 2014. We also examine faint\\nSgr A* fluxes over a long time baseline to search for a quasi-steady quiescent state. We find that Sgr\\nA* displays flux variations over a factor of ∼500, with no evidence for a quiescent state in the NIR.\\nKeywords: black hole physics, accretion, Galaxy: center, techniques: high angular resolution\\n1.INTRODUCTION\\nThe Milky Way’s Galactic center harbors the nearest\\nsupermassive black hole, providing a natural laboratory\\nfor detailed study of physical processes in its vicinity\\n(e.g. Sch¨ odel et al. 2003; Ghez et al. 2008).

The detailed nature of the vari-\\nable emission can provide important constraints on how\\ngas is captured from the black hole’s surrounding envi-\\nronment, as well as on the physical phenomena taking\\nplace within the accretion flow as the matter approaches\\nCorresponding author: Grant C.

While accretion processes have\\nbeen extensively studied in highly luminous active galac-\\ntic nuclei, Sgr A* is an example of the ubiquitous pop-\\nulation of low-luminosity galactic nuclei in the nearby\\nuniverse.

The\\nNIR emission arises primarily from synchrotron radia-\\ntion very close ( ≲15 Schwarzschild radii) to the event\\nhorizon and can be used to bridge the radio and X-ray\\nbands to construct a coherent description of the emission\\nprocesses in radiatively-inefficient, advection-dominated\\nblack hole accretion flows (e.g. Fazio et al. 2018; Witzel\\net al. 2021).\\nThere have been numerous efforts to statistically char-\\nacterize the NIR variability. Do et al. (2009) showed\\nthat light curves from 2005-2007 can be described by a\\nred-noise process that is correlated in time and does not\\nexhibit periodicity or quasi-periodicity. Using observa-\\ntions from 2004-2009, Dodds-Eden et al. (2011) found\\nthe data to be described by a two-state model with a\\nlow-level log-normal component and a separate power-\\nlaw tail for flares. On the other hand, a recent com-\\nprehensive analysis of over 13,000 measurements of Sgr\\nA* flux density with Keck data at 2.12 µm (2003-2014)\\nand VLT and Spitzer data at 4.5 µm (2004-2017) found\\nthat the NIR time variability can indeed be consistently\\ndescribed by red noise, but that the entire distribution\\nof fluxes is well-fit by a single log-normal model without\\na separate flaring component (Witzel et al. 2018). By\\nre-analyzing speckle data from Keck (1995-2005), Chen\\net al. (2019) extended the time baseline of Sgr A* obser-\\nvations and showed that the statistical model of Witzel\\net al. (2018) remained consistent with the data over two\\ndecades through 2018.\\nHowever, in May 2019 Do et al. (2019) observed an\\nunprecedented bright NIR event with Keck. The flux of\\nSgr A* varied by a factor of 75 over a 2-hour timescale\\nand reached twice the level of any previous historical\\nNIR measurement. The maximum fluxes were observed\\nat the beginning of observations, suggesting that Sgr A*\\nwas likely even brighter prior to taking measurements\\nthat night. With additional bright events observed at\\nKeck in 2019, Do et al. (2019) showed the 2019 activ-\\nity to be inconsistent with the historical flux distribu-\\ntion of Witzel et al. (2018). Additionally, a high abun-\\ndance of bright NIR events were observed with VLT\\nin 2019 relative to other years (Gravity Collaboration\\net al. 2020). Heightened activity was also seen in the ra-\\ndio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al. 2022;\\nCheng et al. 2023) and X-ray regimes (e.g. Pavlinsky\\n2019; Degenaar et al. 2019). These observations collec-\\ntively suggest that Sgr A* displayed unusual behavior\\nin 2019, making this era useful for understanding the\\ntime-variable accretion flow onto the black hole.Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the\\nelevated 2019 activity. These possibilities and their ob-\\nservable signatures include the following.\\n1. The statistical models of Sgr A* in the NIR need\\nto be updated to capture the bright events. While\\nWitzel et al. (2018) found that historical mea-\\nsurements follow a single log-normal distribution,\\nGravity Collaboration et al. (2020) argues that\\nthe 2019 bright events observed by Keck and VLT\\nare rare events drawn from the power-law tail of\\nthe underlying two-state distribution described by\\nDodds-Eden et al. (2011). In such two-state mod-\\nels, the faint distribution arises from steady accre-\\ntion of mass from the black hole’s environment,\\nand the flaring state arises from a separate pro-\\ncess that injects additional energy. A related ques-\\ntion concerns whether there exists a quasi-steady,\\nquiescent “floor” to the Sgr A* light curves or\\nwhether Sgr A* displays similar variability char-\\nacteristics at both faint and high levels (e.g. Do\\net al. 2009). Previous studies have historically\\nbeen complicated by short time baselines or have\\nnot closely examined the faint end of the flux dis-\\ntribution. We can examine Sgr A* at low flux\\ndensities over a long time baseline to determine\\nwhether such a quiescent state exists and to study', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

We can also\\nstudy whether the faint flux densities are different\\nin 2019 than in other years. If the 2019 events\\nare indicative of a power-law “flaring” state dis-\\ntinct from the log-normal “quiescent” state, we\\nshould see only the flaring state affected and the\\nfaint end of the flux distribution unchanged be-\\ntween 2019 and other years. A shift in the faint\\nend of the flux distribution in 2019 would instead\\nsuggest that Sgr A* experienced a physical change\\nduring this time.\\n2. There was a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr\\nA*. The Galactic center hosts a population of\\nstars and dusty G-objects, which could affect the\\naccretion flow. The star S0-2 underwent closest\\napproach in 2018, and its passage may have in-\\nduced an accretion disturbance (Loeb 2004). In\\nthe past two decades, the objects G1 and G2 un-\\nderwent closest approach and showed signs of tidal\\ninteraction with the black hole, causing much spec-\\nulation about the potential for excess material\\nfrom these objects to induce heightened Sgr A*\\nactivity (e.g. Gillessen et al. 2012; Phifer et al.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

While an increase in X-ray\\nflares was reported following G2’s passage in 2014\\n(Ponti et al. 2015), no exceptional NIR activity\\nwas reported in the years immediately following\\n2014. However, it is possible that there is a larger\\ntime delay between the passage of G2 and any ob-\\nserved NIR activity (e.g Kawashima et al. 2017;\\nMurchikova 2021). If a neighboring source, such as\\nS0-2 or G2, deposited gas or altered the accretion\\nflow onto Sgr A*, we would expect to see height-\\nened activity for the duration of time it takes that\\nmaterial to fall into the black hole, followed by a\\nreturn to more typical behavior.\\n3. Sgr A* has entered a new accretion state in which\\nbright flares are more common, or the 2019 ac-\\ntivity is a precursor to an even larger event (Do\\net al. 2019). Observations of X-ray light echoes\\nfrom iron line emission at the Galactic center sug-\\ngest that in the past several hundred years, Sgr\\nA* has undergone multiple ( ∼2-10 year) luminos-\\nity increases by factors of up to 105(e.g. Ponti\\net al. 2010; Clavel et al. 2013; Terrier et al. 2018;\\nChuard et al. 2018). If Sgr A* is undergoing a state\\nchange or entering an extreme episode, we should\\nsee the activity of Sgr A* continue or evolve in the\\nyears beyond 2019.\\nTo test these hypotheses, we must compare the be-\\nhavior of Sgr A* before, during, and after 2019 at both\\nlow and high flux densities. Previous studies used dif-\\nferent photometric methods (e.g. aperture photometry,\\npoint spread function fitting, interferometry) and vary-\\ning treatments for stellar contamination of Sgr A*, mak-\\ning the comparison of absolute flux densities unreliable,\\nespecially at fainter levels. In this work, we present\\nSgr A* observations using Keck Observatory from 2005-\\n2022, all reduced with the same methodology, allowing\\nfor a robust comparison of flux densities over time. This\\nstudy includes re-reduced data from Witzel et al. (2018)\\nand Do et al.

Standard image reduction meth-\\nods were applied, including flat-fielding, sky subtraction,\\nand cosmic ray removal via the Keck AO Imaging (KAI)\\ndata reduction pipeline (Lu et al. 2021).\\nPhotometry was performed on individual images to\\nconstruct light curves for Sgr A*. We used the point\\nspread function (PSF) fitting program Starfinder to\\nmeasure the brightness and position of sources (Diolaiti\\net al. 2000). Using the same procedure as in Do et al.\\n(2019), a different PSF was constructed for each image\\nto account for changes in effective PSF due to seeing\\nvariations. To increase the number of Sgr A* detec-\\ntions at faint flux levels, we used an enhanced version\\nofStarfinder that includes a priori knowledge of the\\nlocation of Sgr A* and other nearby NIR sources (Horn-\\nstein et al. 2007). For each epoch, the source locations\\nin a nightly-averaged image were used as fixed inputs\\ninto Starfinder to more accurately fit for Sgr A* and\\nneighboring sources in the individual frames.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

We construct his-\\ntograms of the light curves and present the flux distribu-\\ntions for the pre-2019 (2005-2017), 2019, and post-2019\\n(2020-2022) epochs in Figure 1. In our sample, Sgr A*\\nis detected ∼93% of the time. Our treatment of non-\\ndetections is discussed in Appendix E.\\nAs shown in Do et al. (2019), the 2019 distribution\\nhas a tail extending to high flux densities that is not\\npresent before 2019. Our post-2019 results show no such\\nextended tail, indicating that we have seen no high flux\\ndensities at 2019 levels in more recent years. We observe\\nthat the shapes of the pre- and post-2019 distributions\\nappear to be quite similar, whereas the 2019 distribution\\nappears skewed to higher flux densities.\\nWe are also able to measure the long-term median\\nof the flux distribution, enabled by our consistent re-\\nduction methodology with photometric corrections for\\nstellar confusion. We find that the median of the 2019\\ndistribution is 0.20 mJy (1.9 mJy dereddened), which\\ndoubles the 0.10 mJy (1.0 mJy dereddened) medians of\\nthe pre- and post-2019 distributions. Other percentiles\\nof the flux distribution are presented in Table 2. We\\nobserve that in addition to the median, the flux levels of\\n2019 are elevated at all percentiles compared to the pre-\\nceding and succeeding distributions, demonstrating that\\nthe 2019 behavior was indeed unusual beyond merely\\nthe extremely bright event of 2019-05-13. On the other\\nhand, nearly all percentiles are similar between the pre-\\nand post-2019 distributions. The exception is at the\\nhigh flux end, where discrepancies between the pre- and\\npost-2019 distributions are explained by a recent lack of\\nbright flux excursions. Furthermore, by adding our flux\\ndistributions and dividing by the number of observations\\nwithin each time period, we can compare the average lu-\\nminosity of Sgr A* at 2.12 µm. We find that Sgr A* was\\non average ∼3 times more luminous at this wavelength\\nin 2019 than in the pre-2019 observations. Since 2019,\\nSgr A* has had an average luminosity of ∼0.9 times its\\npre-2019 luminosity.\\nWe can use two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests\\nto quantitatively compare our flux distributions. We\\nnote that KS-tests assume independent measurements\\nand Sgr A* light curves are time-correlated on an intra-\\nnight basis; however, as in Do et al. (2019), we can\\ncompare flux distributions with multiple nights of ob-\\nservations that are uncorrelated with one another to\\nroughly compare the general behavior of Sgr A* over\\nlong time periods. We use the inferred flux distributions\\n(described in Appendix E) to mitigate the bias inducedby non-detections. Performing a KS-test between our\\npre-2019 and 2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of\\n0.39 ( p≪1), showing it is highly unlikely that these\\ndata sets come from the same underlying distribution.\\nDo et al.

Bright events in the NIR Sgr A* light curve\\nThe light curve of Sgr A* over 17 years shows the\\nheightened flux densities in 2019 and relative lack of ac-\\ntivity in the following years (see Figure 3).

Neither of these are comparable to the\\n2019 events.\\nThere is also a lack of bright flux excursions in the\\npost-2019 data as compared to the pre-2019 data. We\\nobserve four events in the pre-2019 data (counting two\\non 2010-05-05) with flux densities greater than 1 mJy\\nand no flux densities at this level post-2019. Six events\\nwith flux densities greater than 0.8 mJy are observed in\\nthe pre-2019 data, and only one is observed post-2019.\\nThe post-2019 sample is only ∼43% as long as the pre-\\n2019 sample, but there remains a relative absence of\\nbright fluxes in more recent years.\\n3.3. Sgr A* has no quiescent state in the NIR\\nOur new methodology allows for measurements of\\nfaint flux densities in the NIR over 17 years and the abil-\\nity to search for a quiescent, quasi-steady state. Such a\\nstate would present itself as a “floor” to the Sgr A* light\\ncurve. This study is the first to examine faint Sgr A*\\nflux densities from 2005-2022 while making corrections\\nfor stellar confusion, allowing for reliable comparisons of\\nfaint Sgr A* flux densities over a long time baseline to\\nsearch for such a floor.We find that there is no quasi-steady floor to the NIR\\nSgr A* light curve at faint flux densities. When viewed\\nin linear flux space (such as the upper light curve in Fig-\\nure 3), Sgr A* does appear to spend most of its time in\\na faint state that is punctuated by bright “flares”. How-\\never, the data show that Sgr A* has been highly variable\\neven at low flux densities over 17 years. By examining\\nthe light curve in logarithmic flux density space (bottom\\nlight curve in Figure 3), we see that Sgr A* shows no qui-\\nescent state in the NIR and instead displays stochastic\\nvariability over a factor of ∼500 in flux. Flux densities\\ndo not level off at some faint value, but are continuously\\nand significantly variable down to about 0.01 mJy (0.1\\nmJy dereddened), which is the limit where we are able\\nto detect Sgr A* with >1σconfidence and which only a\\nsmall fraction of frames likely fall below.\\n3.4.

These findings have implica-\\ntions for understanding the time-variable accretion flow\\nonto Sgr A*.\\nThe pronounced shift in the 2019 median flux density\\nsuggests that Sgr A* experienced a heightened accretion\\nrate, revealing that the 2019 NIR activity was extraor-\\ndinary beyond just the bright events. Gravity Collabo-\\nration et al. (2020) also reported an elevated median in\\n2019 (compared to the years 2017 and 2018), although\\nit was found not statistically significant given the num-\\nber of observations over a time baseline of 3 years. Our\\ntime baseline of 17 years provides stronger evidence for\\na shift in the median of the flux distribution in 2019.\\nThe two-state model for the flux distribution with a log-\\nnormal quiescent state and power-law tail (Dodds-Eden\\net al. 2011; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020) interprets\\nbright flares as manifestations of such a tail, but does\\nnot account for the changes to the faint emission that we\\nobserve in 2019 in this study. Because we see elevated\\nactivity at both low and high levels in 2019, explana-\\ntions invoking a physical change to Sgr A*’s accretion\\nstate are favored over a new statistical model.\\nMulti-wavelength observations of Sgr A* in 2019 also\\nfavor a physical change to the accretion flow. The tem-\\nporal concentration of high fluxes observed in 2019 by\\nKeck and VLT in the NIR, as well as heightened activ-\\nity in radio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al.\\n2022; Cheng et al. 2023) and X-rays (e.g. Pavlinsky 2019;\\nDegenaar et al. 2019) is also evidence for a physical dis-\\nturbance during 2019. If Sgr A*’s variability were bet-\\nter characterized by a different underlying distribution\\nthan that of Witzel et al. (2018) (a single stochastic pro-\\ncess with a log-normal distribution), we would expect tosee bright events and elevated multi-wavelength activity\\nmore evenly distributed over two decades, rather than\\nclustered together in a single year.\\nOur results favor models in which extra gas was de-\\nposited onto the black hole in 2019, temporarily increas-\\ning the accretion rate and stimulating the production of\\nfrequent bright events. Such models include a distur-\\nbance induced by the closest approach of the star S0-2\\nin 2018 or the delayed infall of gas pulled from a tidal in-\\nteraction with the dusty object G2 in 2014. Kawashima\\net al. (2017) predicted a time-delayed radio and infrared\\nbrightening of Sgr A* around 2020 caused by the pas-\\nsage of G2. In their simulations, the magnetic energy\\nwithin the accretion disk increases by a factor of 3-4 af-\\nter∼5 years following the passage of G2. Murchikova\\n(2021) calculates that the infall time of material from G2\\n(and the possible simultaneous infall of material from\\nthe object G1) more closely matches the time delay be-\\ntween pericenter passage and flaring time than that of\\nS0-2. Hydrodynamic simulations have also shown that\\nwinds from the passage of S0-2 are unlikely to have a\\nmeasurable effect on the inner accretion flow (Ressler\\net al. 2018).

If Sgr A* has undergone a change\\nof state, we will catch a real-time glimpse into the phys-\\nical response of a supermassive black hole accretion flow\\nto an increase in gas flow. In any case, it is important to\\ndetermine whether the 2019 activity is representative of\\nSgr A*’s typical behavior or a period of extraordinary\\nactivity. If the former, the 2019 activity should be in-\\ncluded in long-term models of Sgr A*. If the latter, the\\nunusual behavior should be treated as a separate period\\nwith distinct physical characteristics.\\nTo investigate the origin of the 2019 activity, we have\\ndone the following:\\n•Performed a consistent reduction of Keck Sgr A*\\nobservations from 2005-2022 with new treatment\\nfor stellar confusion to enable a robust comparison\\nof flux densities over nearly two decades\\n•Demonstrated that both faint and bright 2019 flux\\ndensities were significantly elevated with respect\\nto pre- and post-2019 observations\\n•Shown that the average luminosity of Sgr A* was\\n∼3 times higher than historical measurements in\\n2019 and ∼0.9 times historical measurements in\\nthe years 2020-2022\\n•Shown that while the post-2019 observations are\\nstatistically consistent with the historical sample,\\nas well as with the statistical model of Witzel et al.(2018), we have observed a relative deficiency in\\nactivity in 2020-2022 at the ∼2σlevel\\n•Demonstrated that 2019 showed heightened vari-\\nability with respect to the years before and after,\\nindicating that a greater average luminosity seems\\ncorrelated with more extreme variability\\n•Found no evidence for a NIR quiescent state of Sgr\\nA*; Sgr A* displays stochastic flux variations over\\na factor of ∼500 and is continuously variable down\\nto about 0.01 mJy\\nWe argue that the observed increase in NIR flux den-\\nsities in 2019, along with the concentration of bright\\nevents measured by many observatories that year, points\\nto a transient increase in accretion activity during 2019.\\nIn these models, excess gas is temporarily deposited onto\\nthe black hole from the closest approach of a nearby ob-\\nject, raising the median flux and increasing the probabil-\\nity of bright events. Numerical simulations and analytic\\ncalculations have favored the black hole’s tidal interac-\\ntion with G2 in 2014 as a source for this excess material.\\nFurther modeling of G-object interactions with the ac-\\ncretion flow and their ability to cause the 2019 activity\\nshould be done to provide a more robust comparison to\\nobservations.\\nWe have ruled out the hypothesis that 2019 is a pre-\\ncursor to a long-term elevated accretion state, as the\\ncurrent behavior of Sgr A* resembles its behavior be-\\nfore 2019, and we have seen a lack of high fluxes in more\\nrecent years.

The magnitude difference between the previous and new photometric calibrations for sources in the central 10\\narcseconds is 0 .093±0.003 and in the central 1 arsecond in 0 .096±0.003, with stars being systematically fainter in the\\nnew calibration (see Figure 5). In this work, we used the following calibrator stars: IRS 16NW, S3-22, S1-17, S1-34,\\nS4-3, S1-1, S1-21, S3-370, S3-88, S3-36, and S2-63. We derived reference flux measurements for the selected calibrator\\nstars using the Sch¨ odel et al. (2010) photometric catalog transformed to the Keck NIRC2 bandpasses. The procedure\\nto transform fluxes from VLT NACO KsandH-bands to Keck NIRC2 K′andH-bands is described in more detail in\\nGautam et al. (2019). More details of our new photometric calibration are forthcoming in Gautam et al. in prep.\\nPhotometric uncertainties were estimated by fitting a power law between the flux level and RMS flux uncertainty\\nfor stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*, as described in Do et al. (2009). We then used this relationship to calculate\\nthe uncertainty in flux measurements for Sgr A*. The photometric uncertainties are generally less than 15% for\\nlow flux values ( ≲0.2 mJy) and less than 5% for high flux values ( ≳0.2 mJy). Sample power law fits to determine\\nflux measurement uncertainties are shown in Figure 6. The flux uncertainties for central arcsecond sources are not\\nsignificantly different between the previous and new photometric calibrations.\\nFigure 5. Comparison of observed magnitudes for Galactic center sources between the photometric calibration of Do et al. (2019) and\\nthe new calibration in this work (Gautam et al. in prep.), as a function of magnitude in the new calibration. We see that sources are\\nsystematically fainter by about 10% with the new calibration.\\nB.PHOTOMETRIC STABILITY\\nWe investigate the photometric stability of our observations by constructing flux distributions for two comparison\\nstars, S1-1 and S1-33, that are known to not be variable and span nearly an order of magnitude in flux (Gautam et al. in\\nprep). The pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 flux distributions of these stars and the nightly mean and standard deviation\\nof the fluxes are presented in Figure 7. We find that the differences between the means and standard deviations of the\\nflux distributions of these stars is not significant between the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 eras. The total 2005-2022\\nflux distribution for S1-1 can be described by a Gaussian with a width of ∼3%, and that of S1-33 can be described by\\na Gaussian with a width of ∼5%. The scatter of mean flux levels between individual nights for S1-1 is ∼2% and for\\nS1-33 is ∼4%. Within individual nights, the average scatter is ∼1% for S1-1 and ∼3% for S1-33. As such, between\\nall of our observations we are able to consistently reproduce the fluxes of S1-1 and S1-33 at the level of a few percent.\\nThe fluctuations in flux density for these non-variable stars are much smaller than the variations in Sgr A* flux density\\nthat we find, indicating that the shifts in the Sgr A* flux distributions that we report are photometrically robust.\\nC.OBSERVATION EPOCHS OMITTED\\nIn Section 2.2, we describe the successive cuts made to our sample to ensure robust photometry and comparisons of\\nSgr A* activity over time. Out of the 104 Galactic center K′observing epochs taken with Keck from 2005-2022, the\\n35 that we have omitted from our analysis are given in Table 4, along with the reasons for omission.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

This procedure makes all the\\ndata comparable, but deletes information about potential shifts in the median flux density caused by changes in the\\naccretion rate. In this study, we seek to measure the shift in the median of the flux distribution between 2019 and\\nother years to examine the accretion flow, so we take a new approach to characterizing confusion.\\nTo correct for the flux bias attributed to Sgr A* for epochs when a known star is within the confusion limit, we\\nsubtract a value informed from simulations of stellar confusion with Sgr A*. We injected synthetic stars near Sgr A* in\\na series of five unconfused images from 2014-05-19 with characteristic data quality (Strehl ratio ∼0.27) and median Sgr\\nA* flux levels ( ∼0.1 mJy), noting that our results are relatively insensitive to these choices within the uncertainties. In\\neach set of images, we planted stars at distances from 0-100 mas (randomly oriented) and K′brightnesses from 14-18\\nmag, then ran Starfinder on the simulated images. See Figure 12 for sample images from our injection procedure. By\\nsubtracting out the known unconfused flux of Sgr A* from our detected value, we are able to obtain an estimate for\\nthe photometric bias induced by the stellar injections. The results of this procedure can be found in Table 7. We also\\nmeasure the position of Sgr A* and report the astrometric biases in Table 8. For injections below 60 mas, the source\\nand Sgr A* are almost always detected as a combined source, making the confusion correction reliable. However, from\\n∼60-80 mas, Sgr A* and the injected star are sometimes detected together, individually, or not at all–with varying flux\\ndensities in each case. While no confusion corrections for 60-80 mas were needed in this study, future studies should\\ntreat this range with care by determining whether Starfinder is detecting Sgr A* and the confused star separately\\nor together. Beyond 80 mas, Sgr A* is unambiguously detected with photometric biases consistent with zero, so no\\ncorrections are needed for stars at these distances.\\nFor the observation epochs affected by stellar confusion, we determined the distance of the confusing star from Sgr\\nA* by performing an orbital fit to aligned images of the Galactic center and obtaining the predicted distance at the', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

In this work, we have excluded epochs in which the bright star S0-2 falls within 60 mas of Sgr A* (July\\n2017-2018), as the uncertainties on S0-2’s flux bias correction are comparable to faint Sgr A* flux levels.

However, these unresolved\\nstars are faint by nature and expected to only slightly shift the median flux density between epochs.\\nI.STRUCTURE FUNCTION ANALYSIS\\nTo convert between the structure function slope βand PSD slope α, we generate 103light curves with the respective\\ntime sampling and fixed PSD slope α, then measure the structure function slope β.

See Figure 14 for the relationships between αandβthat we find from the simulations. We perform\\na linear fit to these values to make the conversion between structure function slope and PSD slope in the data.\\nIn Table 3, we found a shallower PSD slope for the 2020-2022 data compared to the pre-2019 and 2019 data. To\\ndetermine whether a greater white noise component in the post-2019 data is responsible for this shallower slope, we\\nsimulate 103light curves with the post-2019 time sampling assuming an intrisic PSD slope of α= 2.5, then add varying\\nlevels of white noise and fit for a measured value of α(a procedure performed in Do et al. 2019). We find in Figure\\n15 that as the ratio of white noise to red noise becomes ≲10, a flatter PSD slope is indeed measured. As a result, the\\nwhite noise contamination from the stars S0-61 in 2021 and S0-38 in 2022 could have caused a shallower value of αto\\nbe measured for these years.', metadata={'source': '../../data-ingest/data/docs/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

The current highest redshift quasar host\\ndetected3, atz=4.5, required the magnifying effect of a foreground lensing galaxy. Low-luminosity\\nquasars4,5,6from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)7mitigate the\\nchallenge of detecting their underlying, previously-undetected host galaxies. Here we report rest-\\nframe optical images and spectroscopy of two HSC-SSP quasars at z>6with JWST . Using NIRCam\\nimaging at 3.6 µm and 1.5 µm and subtracting the light from the unresolved quasars, we find that\\nthe host galaxies are massive (stellar masses of 13×and3.4×1010M⊙, respectively), compact, and\\ndisk-like. NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy shows stellar absorption lines in the more\\nmassive quasar, confirming the detection of the host. Velocity-broadened gas in the vicinity of these\\nquasars enables measurements of their black hole masses ( 1.4×109and2.0×108M⊙, respectively).\\nTheir location in the black hole mass - stellar mass plane is consistent with the distribution at low\\nredshift, suggesting that the relation between black holes and their host galaxies was already in\\nplace less than a billion years after the Big Bang.\\nThe quasars J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 (coordinates listed in Extended Data Table 1) are at redshifts\\nof6.40and6.34. They have relatively low luminosity ( M1450=−23.87and−23.66mag, respectively),\\nroughly 10 times less luminous than typical bright quasars at these redshifts8,9,10. Using JWST with\\nNIRCam11, we observed J2236+0032 on November 6, 2022 and J2255+0251 on October 26, 2022. Images\\nwere taken in two broad-band filters (F356W and F150W) to detect their host galaxies at 3.56 and 1.50 µm,\\nthus bracketing the rest-frame 4000 Å break, a characteristic feature of galaxy spectra which constrains\\nthe age of the stellar population. Total exposure times were approximately 3,100 seconds for each filter\\nper target.\\nIn Figure 1, we show a 24′′×24′′region and zoomed-in cutouts of the JWST images centered on\\nthe quasars for both filters. As expected, both quasars are detected at high significance. The first\\nquasar J2236+0032 ( mF356W =21.75±0.02mag, mF150W =22.78±0.02,) has no evidence of close\\nneighbors. The second quasar J2255+0251 ( mF356W =22.20±0.02mag, mF150W =23.03±0.02) has\\n2\\ntwo neighboring sources ( <2.6′′) that do not have spectroscopic redshifts at this point; however, their\\ndetection in the HSC r- and i-bands suggests that both of them are at lower redshift than the central quasar.\\nThe detection of an underlying host galaxy requires careful decomposition of the two-dimensional\\nlight distribution to separate the unresolved quasar from its host galaxy. We perform a two-component\\nmodel fit of the rest-frame optical emission in a region of the NIRCam images centered on each target.\\nWe use the software galight12to identify stars from each image to model the two-dimensional (2D)\\npoint-spread function (PSF). We then model each quasar image in each filter as a sum of a point-like quasar\\nand an extended host. The host galaxy was modeled using a 2D Sérsic profile13whose parameters include\\nthe position, size (R eff), axis ratio, orientation, flux, and the radial profile/shape of the light distribution\\n(i.e., Sérsic index), allowing a flexible description of the a priori unknown host galaxy shape. In Extended\\nData Table 1, we report the best-fit parameters and their uncertainties based on the dispersion resulting\\nfrom different PSF models with different modeling techniques (see Methods).\\nAs shown in Figure 2, we detect the host galaxies for both targets, which are visible after subtracting\\nthe quasar point-source model (third column). For J2236+0032, the quasar host is significantly detected\\nin both filters ( mF356W =23.12±0.20mag; mF150W =25.12±0.29mag). The inferred host-to-total flux\\nratios are 25.5±4.4%, and 10.2±2.8%with sizes (R eff) of0.7±0.1kpc and 0.5±0.2kpc for F356W\\nand F150W, respectively. The light distribution is elongated in the same direction (i.e., NE–SW) in the\\ntwo filters, suggesting a mildly inclined disk-like host. For this target, we fix the Sérsic index to 1in both\\nbands – corresponding to an exponential disk model – to avoid non-physical fits; this is supported by a\\nsubsequent fit to the host galaxy emission after subtracting the quasar (see Methods). For J2255+0251,\\nthe host galaxy is clearly detected in the F356W band ( mF356W =24.58±0.30mag) with a host-to-total\\nflux ratio of 9.8±2.6%. The host emission extends southeast (left) of the quasar’s location. The size of\\nthe host is inferred to be R eff=1.5±1.1kpc with a Sérsic index of 1.5±1.4, suggesting a more disk-like\\nthan spheroidal profile. The host galaxy is not detected in the F150W image, resulting in an upper limit\\nofmF150W=26.3mag (see Methods). This upper limit provides an important constraint on the galaxy\\nspectral energy distribution (SED). A non-detection is not surprising, given the low host-to-total flux ratio\\nin the F356W band and the fact that galaxies are typically fainter blueward of the 4000 Å break. We\\nuse NIRSpec14observations to demonstrate that the contribution of extended line emission to the host\\nphotometry in F356W is minimal (See Methods).\\nOur two photometric bands lie on either side of the 4000 Å break, allowing us to quantify the\\ncontributions of young and relatively old stars, and thus to estimate the stellar masses of the two quasar\\nhost galaxies. We fit the SED of each host with a single stellar population, in which the stellar metallicity\\nlogZ/Z⊙is constrained to the range [−1,−0.3], the stellar age is within the range [0.01,0.84]Gyr (capped\\nby the age of the universe at redshift 6.4), and the extinction A vis in the range of [0,5.0]mag. With\\nstandard assumptions on the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF), we find that J2236+0032 has a stellar mass\\nof1.3+2.0\\n−0.6×1011M⊙, while J2255+0251 is less massive with 3.4+7.6\\n−1.9×1010M⊙. We use simulations and\\nthree different SED fitting codes to demonstrate that the results are robust, although further observations\\nwill lessen potential systematic errors in these mass estimates (see Methods for full details on our mass\\nestimates and their uncertainties). Our host galaxies are among the highest stellar mass galaxies known at\\nz∼6 (ref. 15).\\nA rest-frame optical spectrum of each quasar was obtained by the NIRSpec instrument on JWST\\n(Figure 3). These spectra cover 2.87–5.27 µm, or approximately 4000–7000 Å in the rest-frame, revealing\\nstrong emission lines including the H β+[O III] multiplet, H α, and blended Fe IIpseudo-continuum. The\\n0.′′2-wide slit was fortuitously aligned along the major axis of the host galaxy of J2236+0032 (Figure 2).\\nRemarkably, we serendipitously identify stellar absorption lines (H γ, Hδ, and H ε) in J2236+0032. Thus\\nthe contribution of stellar light is confirmed both from the imaging and spectroscopy in this object. We\\n3/27\\nuse the velocity width of the broad H βemission line and the rest-frame 5100 Å continuum luminosity to\\nestimate the mass of the central black hole, under the assumption that the high-velocity gas is governed\\nby the gravity of the SMBH. Using a recipe calibrated in the local universe16and subtracting the stellar\\nemission, we obtain virial masses of M BH=1.4×109M⊙for J2236+0032, and M BH=2.0×108M⊙for\\nJ2255+0251, respectively (see Methods).\\nFigure 4 shows the two z∼6.4quasars in the black hole mass – stellar mass plane (left panel), as\\nwell as the inferred underlying relation compared to the local relation (right panel). As is observed in the\\nlocal universe, the quasar hosting the more massive black hole is hosted by the more massive galaxy. To\\nevaluate their location in the M BH– M∗plane relative to the local mass relation, we carry out a simulation,\\nfollowing ref. 17, that takes into account the selection effects for these two quasars in the HSC survey.\\nFor this purpose, we combine the quasar flux limits, the estimated BH mass and accretion rate functions\\natz∼6, as well as uncertainty in our stellar mass estimates to predict the expected M BHfor these two\\nquasars – under the baseline assumption that the M BH–M∗relation does not evolve between z=6.4and\\nthe present. In the left panel, the orange contours show the resulting bivariate probability distribution for\\nthe location of these two quasars, with the measured values overplotted in red. Our two z>6quasars\\nfall within the probability distribution (orange contours) of this simulated z∼6.4sample and are thus\\nconsistent with no evolution of the M BH–M∗relation from z∼6.4toz=0, as shown for the inferred\\nunderlying relation in the right panel of Figure 4. With just two quasars, the probability distribution of the\\nnominal evolution strength is broad as suggested by the width of these uncertainties (see also Extended\\nData Figure 6 in the Methods). However, ongoing JWST observations will give us a significantly larger\\nsample, allowing us to better constrain models for the mutual evolution of the black hole and stellar\\npopulations in galaxies18,19,20.\\nReferences\\n1.Mechtley, M. et al.

Milky Way\\ndust extinction is negligible at the near-infrared wavelengths of interest and is not corrected for.\\nTarget selection\\nThe two objects presented here are part of our Cycle 1 JWST program (Observation ID 1967; PI: M.Onoue)\\nwhich targets 12 of the lowest-luminosity quasars at redshift 6.0 to 6.4 (ref. 23) discovered by the Hyper\\nSuprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program7, an optical wide-field survey using the 8.2-meter Subaru tele-\\nscope. These quasars were spectroscopically confirmed by ground-based follow-up observations4,5,6. The\\nquasars exhibit broad Ly αemission and strong intergalactic medium absorption blueward of Ly α. This\\ndeep survey, which is sensitive to quasars a factor of 10 less luminous than those discovered by shallower\\nsurveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (see Extended Data Figure 1).\\nNIRCam Observations and data reduction\\nThe data presented in this paper were taken with Module B of the NIRCam instrument, which has a field\\nof view of 2.2×2.2square arcminutes. Total exposures of 3,100 seconds in the two filters (F356W and\\nF150W) were obtained simultaneously. A 4×4primary and sub-pixel dithering pattern was employed\\nto mitigate cosmic ray hits and bad pixels in the detector and to ensure sub-pixel resampling during the\\nstacking step. We used the INTRAMODULEBOX andSTANDARD dithering patterns for the primary\\nand sub-pixel dithers, respectively. We used the BRIGHT1 readout mode.\\nThe data were processed using the standard procedures in JWST pipeline version 1.7.2. The pre-\\ncalibrated “Stage 2” image frames were downloaded from the MAST archive. These images have\\nthe pipeline parameter reference files jwst_1009.pmap for J2255+0251 and jwst_1011.pmap for\\nJ2236+0032, as registered in the JWST Calibration Reference Data System1. For individual frames, global\\nbackground light was first subtracted using the Background2D function of Photutils24. The archived\\nimages clearly have horizontal and vertical stripe noise patterns, known as “ 1/fnoise”. This 1/fnoise was\\nsubtracted by first masking bright objects, then collapsing the 2D images along each axis of the detectors\\nand estimating the noise amplitudes by measuring sigma-clipped median values. These amplitudes were\\nthen subtracted from each row and column. The horizontal stripes were measured for each of the four\\ndetector amplifiers separately. These post-processed Stage 2 image frames were then aligned and stacked\\nwith inverse-variance weighting using the Stage 3 pipeline, keeping the original position angle of the\\ndetector for the purpose of building the PSF library. Both F356W and F150W images were resampled with\\na pixel scale a factor of two smaller than that of the detector, using the drizzling algorithm implemented in\\ntheResample step of the pipeline. The final pixel scales for F356W and F150W are 0.′′0315 and0.′′0153 ,\\nrespectively.\\n2D image decomposition of quasar and host galaxy emission using galight\\nAccurate decomposition of the image of a quasar into a central point source and an extended host galaxy\\nrequires a high-quality model for the PSF based on stars detected in the same image as the quasars.\\nSpace-based telescopes have a much sharper and more stable PSF than ground-based telescopes, and\\ntheHubble Space Telescope (HST) has been used to measure quasar host galaxies to redshift up to z∼2\\n(ref. 12,25,26,27). However, HST’s∼90-minute orbit means that it is continually passing between Earth’s\\n1https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu\\n10/27\\nshadow and direct sunlight, causing the telescope to expand and contract (“orbital breathing”) and giving\\nrise to a time-dependent PSF. The difficulty of modeling the PSF has not allowed quasar host galaxies to\\nbe detected significantly beyond z≳3(ref. 1,2,28,29), where host starlight can be only measured through\\nthe SED fitting method30.\\nHere, we follow our tested strategy12, including the analysis of JWST images32, and build a PSF\\nlibrary by identifying all isolated, unsaturated stars of sufficient signal-to noise ratio (SNR) in our\\nimages. We identified 12 |16 PSF stars in filter F150W |F356W for J2236+0032 and 9 |5 PSF stars in\\nfilter F150W |F356W in the images for J2255+0251. We use our two-dimensional modeling software\\ngalight12to fit the quasar images with a model of a scaled PSF (the spatially unresolved point-like\\nquasar) and a PSF-convolved 2D Sérsic profile (the host galaxy). galight is apython -based open-\\nsource package2that utilizes the image modeling capabilities of lenstronomy31. It has been adopted\\nfor quasar decomposition of images by HST12,JWST32, and the HSC survey33. We adopt uniform priors\\nfor the effective radius R eff∈[0.′′03,2.′′0]and the Sérsic index ( n)∈[0.3,9]of the host to avoid unphysical\\nparameter inference. For J2255+0251, there is one nearby object which we fit simultaneously with a Sérsic\\nprofile, allowing us to correct for its effect on the host galaxy properties.\\nWe obtain a weighted inference for the decomposition result as briefly described here. After subtracting\\nthe remaining local background, we use each PSF in our library in turn to fit the image. The performance\\nof each PSF is determined by its best-fit χ2value. We select groups of two, three, and five PSFs from the\\nlibrary that have the top level χ2performance and then average them using psfr (Birrer et al. in prep).\\nTo optimize our modeling of the unresolved quasar emission, we consider both best-fit models using\\nindividual stars and average models based on the combined PSF stars described above. Thus, we add the\\nthree averaged PSFs as new members to the PSF library. We take the results from the five top-performing\\nPSF models in the updated library. We determine our final result parameters by weighting their χ2values,\\nas defined by ref. 12, Eq. (3)-(6). The uncertainties we quote are based on the dispersion in the host\\nproperties from these five different PSF models. Errors based on variation in the PSF models are often\\nsignificantly larger than the formal fitting errors, as has been recently demonstrated using simulations and\\nobservations of quasars and their host galaxies34. The final inferred host filter magnitude, size, Sérsic\\nindex, and other fit parameters are presented in Extended Data Table 1. The images in Figure 2 are based\\non the PSF with the best performance. The sizes of our host galaxies are defined using the Sérsic effective\\nradius R effalong the semi-major axis measured by galight .\\nThe quasar host of J2236+0032 appears to be a compact galaxy. As a result, we find that the Sérsic n\\nis poorly constrained, and the resulting host residual is point-like with an inferred R effof0.′′03(the lower\\nlimit of the prior), indicating that the central PSF has not been fully removed. This model implies a stellar\\nmass with an implausibly high value above 1011.8M⊙given the SED fitting described below. Thus, we\\nrefit this object, fixing n=1in both F356W and F150W. This gives a much-improved model. The host is\\nquite elongated in F356W, suggesting that it is a disky edge-on galaxy. We also find a consistent position\\nangle between F356W and F150W, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, for J2236+0032, we adopt the results with\\nSérsic nfixed to 1. We further directly fit the “data −quasar\" residual image (i.e., host) with the Sérsic\\nmodel and allow the Sérsic index to vary. When we do so, the inferred nis 1.55 with values of R effand the\\nhost magnitude consistent with those with the n=1 fit.\\nSince J2255+0251 has no clear host detection in the F150W band, we re-model the data and fix the\\nhost galaxy parameters (host Sérsic index, R eff, ellipticity, and position angle) to the values inferred from\\nthe F356W band, while allowing the central position and amplitude to vary. We still see no evidence for a\\nhost residual, but the model gives a formal host magnitude of 26.3±0.2mag. We quote these inferences\\n2https://galight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n11/27\\nin Extended Data Table 1 and adopt a lower limit to the magnitude of 26 .3 mag.\\nConfirmation of our 2D decomposition using galfit\\nIn the fitting routine described above, the results are sensitive to the setting of certain parameters. For\\ninstance, a sub-pixel shift of the PSF is typically needed to optimally align with the position of the quasar.\\nThis interpolation within a pixel can result in modest variations in the allocation of flux between the\\nquasar and its host galaxy. In galight , the parameter point_source_supersampling_factor\\ncontrols this interpolation. For guidance here on the optimal setting, we compared our results with the\\ndecomposition from galfit35while implementing different supersampling factor values, i.e., 1 (no\\ninterpolation) and 2. The choice of supersampling factor had a greater impact on the F150W decomposi-\\ntion than that on the F356W image. We found that the two codes are in close agreement when using a\\nsupersampling_factor of 2 as shown in Extended Data Figure 2 and reported in Extended Data\\nTable 1. As a result, to account for the uncertainty associated with this setting, we report the averaged\\nresults obtained using both supersampling_factor values of 1 and 2, with uncertainties covered by\\nthese two settings.\\nTests of the robustness of the host galaxy properties\\nWe perform several sanity checks for our two quasars to confirm that the detections of their host galaxies\\nare real. First, our final reduced data are co-added using 16 dithers. To check whether the apparent host is\\ncaused by a random ghost from any particular dither frame, we reanalyze the data using the first 8 and the\\nsecond 8 dithers separately. We are able to detect the host from both halves of the data. To ensure that the\\napparent host galaxy flux is not dominated by a mismatched PSF core, we mask the quasar center (using a\\n0.′′12and0.′′06radius aperture for F356W and F150W, respectively) and redo the fit. Again, the host is\\nwell-detected.\\nTo rule out the possibility that the residual emission (host galaxy) is an artifact of the chosen PSF stars,\\nwe selected the five top-performing PSF in the library, and identified twenty pairs from these. We then fit\\none PSF with the other without assuming any host component for all pairs. We performed this test for stars\\nin the fields of J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 in both bands; residual images show no extended features\\nin any case. This is illustrated for J2255+0251 in the F356W filter in the top panels of Extended Data\\nFigure 3. We also fit galaxy + host models to pure PSF images, in which case the inferred host magnitudes\\nwere roughly two magnitudes fainter than the hosts detected around the quasars. In contrast, we clearly\\ndetect the quasar host when we use any of the five library PSFs and, using these stellar residual maps to\\nmeasure the standard deviation, we display the maps of the host signal-to-noise ratio for all images of our\\ntwo quasars in the bottom panels of Extended Data Figure 3.\\nWe carried out three sets of simulations to further validate our host detections, including J2255+0251\\nin the F356W filter and J2236+0032 in the F356W and F150W filters. In one realization of the simulation,\\nwe randomly select a PSF from the five top-ranked PSFs in the library, and add a Sérsic profile using the\\nbest-fit parameters from our model inference. We sample the resulting mock quasar +host image at the\\nobserved resolution and insert it into a random empty position in the JWST NIRCam data. We then model\\nthe images with the other four PSF stars, and select the result with the best performance. We repeated this\\nsimulation a hundred times to quantify the bias and standard deviation of the inferred values around the\\ntrue values. We found that the key Sérsic parameters can be obtained accurately, with biases well below\\n1σin all quantities. For J2255+0251, the bias (obtained −truth) and scatter of the inferred host magnitude\\nare−0.02±0.11. For J2236+0032, the magnitude bias and scatter are 0.01 ±0.14 and −0.13±0.16 for\\nF356W and F150W, respectively. We present the distributions of the inferred host magnitudes in the\\nsimulations of J2255+0251 (F356W) in Extended Data Figure 4. We note that these simulation tests were\\n12/27\\nconducted with point_source_supersampling_factor set to 1. The similar scatter distribution\\ncan be found when setting this parameter to 2.\\nFinally, we tested the fidelity of the host magnitude inference using a joint fit across the two bands. We\\nfix the host galaxy parameters for J2236+0032 (where the host is detected in F150W), setting the Sérsic\\nparameters to those inferred from F356W; we find a very similar host magnitude to the value when all\\nparameters are allowed to vary: the changes in the inferred host magnitude are within 0.1 mag.\\nStellar mass of the host galaxy\\nWe use SED fitting to estimate the stellar masses of our two host galaxies at z∼6.4using the photometry\\nand its uncertainty based on NIRCam imaging with two filters (F356W and F150W) which straddle the\\nrest-frame 4000 Å break. The host galaxy of J2255+0251 is not detected in the F150W filter, thus we\\ntake 26.3mag as a lower limit on the magnitude. We adopt a Chabrier IMF in our analysis to allow direct\\ncomparison with the local black hole - host galaxy mass relations (e.g., ref. 21,22). Contributions of\\nnebular emission lines from the host galaxies are also allowed with a uniform log ionization parameter\\nlogUover the range [−3,−1]. Three key parameters define the shape of the SED template: age, metallicity,\\nand dust attenuation (A v). We adopt a uniform prior on the age over the range [0.01, 0.84] (in Gyr),\\nextending to the age of the universe at z=6.4. We adopt a uniform prior in metallicity logZ/Z⊙over\\nthe range [−1,−0.3]following ref. 36,37. We assume an A vrange of [0, 5.0] mag for both targets. For\\nJ2255+0251, the F150W band has an upper limit on the flux thus the constraint on A vis weaker; hence,\\nwe assume A vfollows a log-normal distribution with a median value at 0.85 as supported by recent JWST\\nobservations of high-redshift galaxies38. A measurement of the Balmer decrement (i.e., the ratio of narrow\\nHαand H βin the spectrum) implies an attenuation A v=0.67±0.13 mag for the narrow-line region (Onoue\\net al., in prep), consistent with the median extinction value of our prior. We also note that for J2236+0032,\\nthe contribution of the host in the spectrum (Onoue et al., in prep) has a magnitude in close agreement\\nwith the NIRCam photometry, supporting our stellar mass estimate.\\nWe use gsf39to perform the SED model fitting. This software generates a set of templates with\\na range of ages and metallicities according to the prior to fit a composite stellar population (CSP)-like\\nstar formation history. A random parameter sampling is performed through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo\\n(MCMC) to infer the probability distribution of the SED parameters. For J2236+0032 and J2255+0251,\\nthe inferred values of log M ∗are11.12+0.40\\n−0.27and10.53+0.51\\n−0.37(in units of M⊙), respectively, as shown in\\nExtended Data Table 1. In Extended Data Figure 5, we present the best-fit SEDs of the two quasar hosts,\\nin which the MCMC inference indicates that the stellar mass is mildly sensitive to age and metallicity but\\nis more sensitive to A v. We also adopt the same configuration for the independent code Bagpipes40\\nandCIGALE41to perform SED fits; we find values of M ∗that change by 0.1 dex or less. The robust\\nmeasurement of stellar mass is due to having photometry on both sides of the 4000 Å break, accurate\\nspectroscopic redshifts, and a firm upper limit of the stellar age 0.84 Gyr, given the age of the universe at\\nz=6.4. Even so, we note that additional systematic uncertainties may be unaccounted for thus leading to\\ngreater uncertainty in the mass estimates than we have quoted.\\nNIRSpec Observations and data reduction\\nThe NIRSpec Fixed-Slit data for the two quasars were obtained on October 30, 2022 for J2236+0032 and\\nOctober 28, 2022 for J2255+0251. The targets were aligned onto the 0.′′2×3.′′2S200A2 slit and observed\\nwith the medium-resolution ( R∼1000 ) G395M grating, which covers 2.87 – 5.27 µm in the observed\\nframe. Total exposures of 1,970 seconds were obtained for each target.\\nThe spectroscopic data were processed with the JWST pipeline version 1.8.5. Raw ( uncal ) data\\nwere downloaded from the MAST archive, which has the parameter reference files jwst_1027.pmap .\\n13/27\\nThe stage 1 calibration was performed with the default parameters but with the function to detect large\\ncosmic-ray hits on the detector turned on during the Jump step. The 1/fnoise along the vertical direction\\nwas subtracted from the Stage 1 products using the same method as that for NIRCam images. Pixels\\nof the science frames flagged as bad or saturated were masked based on the associated Data Quality\\nframes. During the Stage 2 data processing, including flat-fielding and flux calibration, we use in-flight\\nmeasurements of spectrophotometric standard stars ( jwst_nirspec_fflat_0065.fits ) to convert the detector\\nsignals into physical units. The signal loss due to the optical system and the finite width of the S200A2\\nslit were corrected in the Pathloss step by applying built-in correction factors for a point source as a\\nfunction of wavelength. The two-dimensional spectra at each dither position were then stacked using\\nthe Stage 3 pipeline. The pixel resampling scale was kept to the original pixel scale of the detector. A\\n6-pixel-wide box-car aperture (0 .′′6 wide) was employed to extract the one-dimensional spectrum from the\\nstacked spectrum.\\nSpectrum fitting\\nWe use a public code QSOFitMORE42(version 1.2.03) with custom modification to fit the NIRSpec\\nrest-optical spectra of the two quasars. The continuum emission is fitted with two components: power-law\\nemission from the accretion disk, and a pseudo-continuum from the forest of singly-ionized iron emission.\\nQSOFitMORE uses an empirical iron template of ref. 43. The rest-frame 5100 Å monochromatic\\nluminosity ( L5100) is derived from the best-fit power-law continuum model with a power-law index of αλ\\n(i.e., flux density Fλ∝λαλ).\\nEmission lines are modeled with a combination of one or more Gaussian profiles. J2236+0032 needs\\none broad component for H β, while the adjacent forbidden emission of [O III]λλ4960 ,5008 requires\\none narrow component and another blueshifted broad component. The narrow [O III] doublet is forced to\\nhave the same line width without velocity offsets between the two. The [O III] redshifts of the two targets\\nare derived from the peaks of the narrow [O III] components. The [O III] redshift of J2236+0032 agrees\\nwell with the location of the absorption lines we detect in H γ, Hδ, and H ε(Figure 3). The H β+[O III] line\\nprofile as well as the continuum properties of J2236+0032 are reported in Extended Data Table 2. A full\\ndescription of the fitting procedure and other emission line properties will be presented in Onoue et al. (in\\nprep.).\\nBH mass estimates\\nThe central black hole masses M BHof the two quasars are measured by the single-epoch method using\\nbroad H βemission lines. Assuming that the broad H βemission traces the kinematics of the gas orbiting\\nin the vicinity of the SMBHs (the so-called broad-line-region), one can use the line width of H βas a proxy\\nof the rotation velocity of the broad-line-region gas. There is also an empirical correlation between the\\nrest-frame 5100 Å continuum luminosity ( L5100) and the radius from the SMBH to the broad-line-region\\ngas, which is observed by the reverberation mapping technique44. In this paper, we use the recipe provided\\nby ref. 16 to estimate the black hole mass:\\nMBH=106.91\\x12L5100\\n1044erg s−1\\x130.50\\x12FWHM Hβ\\n103km s−1\\x132\\nM⊙. (1)\\nBased on the spectrum fitting results described above, we derive virial BH masses of M BH= (1.54±\\n0.27)×109M⊙for J2236+0032 and M BH= (2.02±0.17)×108M⊙for J2255+0251. Note that these\\n3https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4893646\\n14/27\\nvirial SMBH masses have intrinsic uncertainties of 0.4 dex16, which is not included in the error budget\\nabove. We report the derived BH properties in Extended Data Table 2.\\nWe estimate the host galaxy contribution to the rest-optical continua of the NIRSpec spectra, using the\\ndecomposed host galaxy images in the NIRCam’s F356W filter. Referring to the relative position angle\\nof the NIRCam and NIRSpec observations, we find that the stellar emission falling inside the 0.′′2×0.′′6\\nextraction aperture is 21.8% (J2236+0032) and 4.8% (J2255+0251) with respect to the total emission.\\nWe interpret this as the fraction of the host starlight in the observed continuum emission in the NIRSpec\\nG395M spectrum for each source, which allows us to correct the 5100 Å continuum luminosity to that from\\nthe quasar emission alone. Accordingly, the virial BH masses become M BH= (1.36±0.15)×109M⊙\\nfor J2236+0032 and M BH= (1.97±0.17)×108M⊙for J2255+0251, respectively. These corrected BH\\nproperties are reported in Extended Data Table 2, and are adopted in Figure 4. This correction is more\\nsignificant for J2236+0032, in which stellar absorption lines are detected (Figure 3).\\nEmission from H β+[O III] in the hosts\\nOur SED model allows for the inclusion of the H β+[O III] line emission that falls within the F365W filter\\n(Extended Data Figure 5). However, if those lines were of high equivalent width in the hosts, they could\\naffect the broad-band photometry used in the stellar mass inference, especially if the gas is ionized by\\nthe quasar45,46. To ensure that our NIRCam detection of extended host emission is not dominated by\\nthese lines, we directly compare the total flux of the H β+[O III] narrow lines seen in our spectra with the\\ncontribution from the host in the NIRCam image within the aperture of the spectral slit. For J2236+0032,\\nnarrow H βemission is not detected and the [O III] emission in NIRSpec contributes only ∼3%of the\\nhost galaxy light.\\nFor J2255+0251, the narrow H β+[O III] emission is comparable to the host galaxy brightness measured\\nin the F356W filter. Much of this emission may be coming from the narrow-line region of the quasar itself.\\nTo quantify the impact on the detection of the stellar continuum, we use the 2D NIRSpec spectroscopic\\ndata and fit a Gaussian to the unresolved spatial profile at each wavelength, allowing the centroid to\\nvary linearly with wavelength, setting the width to be the same as the spatial PSF as measured from a\\npublicly available reference star in the same spectroscopic configuration as our observations, and letting\\nthe amplitude be a free parameter. The best-fit Gaussian profile at each wavelength is then subtracted\\nfrom the 2D spectrogram to reveal any spatially extended [O III] emission in the spectrum. A background\\nregion of equivalent size is subtracted from the extended emission region. We calculate the flux density of\\nthe extended emission in the F356W band and compare it to the flux density of the NIRCam host galaxy\\nwithin the aperture of the NIRSpec slit on the sky. For J2255+0251, the [O III] extended emission has a\\nmagnitude of 27.6, which is 11% of the flux of the observed host galaxy within the slit aperture. Note that\\nthe measurement of the extended emission is based on the observational fact that the apparent minor axis\\nof J2255+0251 is wider than the scale of the PSF in F356W (see Figure 2). We thus conclude that the\\nmajority of the narrow H β+[O III] emission in J2255+0251 comes from the unresolved quasar, which has\\nbeen removed by our quasar decomposition. For J2236+0032, we use the same approach and find that the\\nextended [O III] has a magnitude of 27.5 mag. The flux ratio between the extended [O III] and the host\\ngalaxy within the slit is ∼3%. No extended H βemission was detected in either target.\\nConstruction of mock quasar and host galaxy sample at z =6.4\\nWe use the method described in ref. 17to generate mock samples to assess the expected location of our\\ntwo quasars in the black hole - stellar mass plane. We start with a large galaxy sample representative of\\nthe population at z∼6based on the stellar mass function15. We then assume that the ratio of black hole to\\nhost stellar mass and its dispersion are the same as the local values (i.e., no evolution). As an update on\\n15/27\\nthis procedure, we now use the BH Eddington rate distribution of ref. 47to assign quasar luminosities.\\nObservational uncertainty on M ∗and intrinsic uncertainty on M BHare incorporated with a selection on\\nmagnitude ( −23.9<M1450<−23.8) is applied. The orange contours in Figure 4 show the resulting\\nbivariate probability distribution in the stellar mass-black hole mass plane. We further generate samples\\nfor different evolution rates (M BH/M∗∝(1+z)γ) in steps of 0.1 in γand under the assumption that the\\ndispersion is the same as the local value (ref. 17,48demonstrates that the evolution rate and dispersion are\\ndegenerate). The probability distribution of γis determined given our measurements of both M BHand M ∗\\nof our two quasars (Extended Data Figure 6); γlies in the range −0.40 to +0.84 with 68% confidence.\\n23.Matsuoka, Y ., et al.

Introduction\\nQuasars, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in general, are powered by accretion onto the\\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of their host galaxies. Quasars are the most\\nluminous non-transient sources in the Universe, and have been observed up to a redshift\\nofz∼7.6 (Wang et al. 2021b). SMBH activities are a key ingredient of galaxy formation.\\nQuasars provide crucial probes of galaxy evolution and cosmology across cosmic history at\\nthree critical spatial scales:\\n1. At the scale of the AGN central engine ( <1pc), quasar emission originates from well\\nwithin the SMBH sphere of inﬂuence, at which the gravitational inﬂuence of the BH\\ndominates. Quasars are fundamental in understanding the physics of BH accretion\\nand growth and the physics of AGN activity.\\n2. At the scale of quasar host galaxies ( ∼1−10 kpc), the evolution of quasars and\\ngalaxies are strongly coupled, as shown by the tight correlation between SMBH mass\\nand the mass/velocity dispersion of their host galaxies seen at low redshift (e.g, the\\nM-σrelation, Kormendy & Ho 2013). Quasars are key to understand the assembly,\\n2 Fan et al.\\ngrowth and quenching of massive galaxies.\\n3. At the scale of galaxy clusters and superclusters ( >Mpc), quasars can be used to\\nprobe the growth of early large scale structure. They also provide sightlines to study\\nthe properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM), including the history of cosmic\\nreionization, the chemical enrichment of the IGM, the distribution of baryons and\\nthe evolution of ionization state of the IGM, and its connection to galaxy formation\\nthrough the circumgalactic medium (CGM).\\nThe history of quasar studies is driven and shaped by innovations in systematic surveys\\nand multiwavelength observations of quasars. These observations aim to reaching higher\\nredshift, covering the full range of quasar luminosities, and spatially resolving quasar hosts\\nand their central AGN structure. Studies of high-redshift quasars within the ﬁrst few billion\\nyears of cosmic history started with the advent of large area digital or digitized sky surveys,\\nhighlighted by progress made using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York\\net al. 2000), which resulted in the ﬁrst detections of quasars at z>5 andz>6 (Fan et al.\\n2001). Observations of z∼6 quasars in the early 2000s provided fundamental insights in\\nthe three key scales of galaxy evolution mentioned above:\\n1. SMBHs with masses up to a few billion M⊙already existed in the Universe within\\none billion years after the Big Bang, requiring a combination of early massive BH\\nseeds and rapid BH accretion.\\n2. Early luminous quasars are sites of intensive galaxy-scale star formation and the\\nassembly of early massive galaxies.\\n3. Detection of strong IGM absorption in quasar spectra, especially the emergence of\\ncomplete Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs (Gunn & Peterson 1965) shows a rapid\\ntransition of the ionization state of the IGM at z∼5−6, marking this epoch as the\\nend of cosmic reionization.\\nIn this review, we will focus on the progress since then, including the quests for the\\nearliest quasars, and the detailed studies of quasars during and right after the epoch of\\nreionization (EoR). We will limit our discussions to: (1) the redshift range of z > 5.3;\\nthis is the lower redshift limit at which there are still detectable signatures of reionization\\nactivity. This redshift corresponds to 1.1 Gyr after the Big Bang, when the Universe was at\\n8% of its current age. We consider z>5.3 as “cosmic dawn” in the context of this review.\\n(2) Luminous Type-1 quasars, for which secure spectroscopic observations and systematic\\nsurveys are currently possible. (3) IGM studies using quasar absorption spectra; we will\\nnot discuss other probes of EoR in detail. This review will focus mainly on observations,\\nand we will discuss theories and simulations largely in the context of understanding and\\npredicting observations.\\nAt the time of this review, JWST has started routine observations, and initial JWST\\nresults have begun to appear in the literature. We will not include any early JWST results\\nin this article. JWST observations of high-redshift quasars will undoubtedly provide many\\nnew insights that will result in discoveries and challenges that should be the subject of a\\nfuture review.\\nThere have been a number of excellent Annual Review articles on related topics which\\nwe will not repeat: Inayoshi et al. (2020) reviewed topics related to the initial BH seeds and\\nearly growth; Kormendy & Ho (2013) presented a very detailed discussion of BH/galaxy co-\\nevolution; Carilli & Walter (2013) reviewed early (pre-ALMA) sub/mm observations of high-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 3\\nredshift galaxies; including quasar hosts. Fan et al. (2006a) discussed early observational\\nstudies of reionization; McQuinn (2016) provided a general discussion of the evolution of\\nthe IGM.\\nThis review is organized as follows: In Section 2, we will review the progress in searching\\nfor the highest redshift quasars and in establishing large sample of quasars at cosmic dawn,\\nas a result of the new generations of wide-ﬁeld sky surveys and the developments in data\\nmining and machine learning. In this Section, we will present a database of all published\\nType-1 quasars at z > 5.3. In Section 3, we will discuss the evolution of quasars as a\\npopulation at high redshift, and present the measurements of quasar luminosity function,\\nand the trend in the evolution of quasar intrinsic properties in early epochs. We will also\\nhighlight special populations of high-redshift quasars. In Section 4, we will discuss the use\\nof high-redshift quasars as probes to the history of SMBH growth in the early Universe,\\nand review statistics of measurements of quasar BH masses and accretion characteristics.\\nIn Section 5, we will review the observations of quasar host galaxies from the rest-frame UV\\nto far-IR, in the context of the co-evolution of early SMBH growth and galaxy formation,\\nand the roles quasar played in early galaxy and structure formation. In Section 6, we\\nwill review the the progress in using IGM absorption in quasar sight lines and properties\\nof quasar proximity zones to probe the history of cosmic reionization and IGM chemical\\nenrichment. Throughout this review, we assume a spatially ﬂat LCDM cosmological model\\nwith Ωm= 0.3 andH0= 70 km s−1Mpc−1, consistent with the ﬁnal Planck results.\\n2. THE QUASAR REDSHIFT FRONTIER\\nAdvances in the studies of high-redshift quasars are ﬁrst and foremost driven by advances in\\nhigh-redshift quasar surveys and new discoveries. The quasar redshift frontier continues to\\nexpand as a result of new sky surveys: the ﬁrst quasar discoveries at z>4 in the 1980s were\\nmade possible by digital or digitized large sky surveys and the ﬁrst implementations of color\\ndrop-out selection techniques (e.g., Warren et al. 1987). After the SDSS discoveries of the\\nﬁrstz>5 (Fan et al. 1999) and z>6 (Fan et al. 2001) quasars in the early 2000s, wide-ﬁeld\\nnear-infrared (NIR) sky surveys in the following decade, such as UKIDSS (Lawrence et al.\\n2007) led to the detection of the ﬁrst quasars at z >7 (e.g., Mortlock et al. 2011), deep\\ninto the EoR. At the time of this review, the quasar redshift frontier stands at z= 7.64\\n(Wang et al. 2021b). Meanwhile, increasingly large samples of high-redshift quasars are\\nestablished by continued mining and systematic spectroscopic followup observations based\\non these new surveys. Currently, about 1000 quasars have been discovered at z >5, and\\nmore than 200 at z>6.\\n2.1. Progress in High-Redshift Quasar Surveys\\nSurveys of the highest redshift quasars face three technical challenges. First, quasars at\\ncosmic dawn are among the rarest objects in the Universe. The ﬁnal SDSS z∼6 quasar\\nsample covers more than 11,000 deg2, but contains only 52 quasars (Jiang et al. 2016).\\nTheir discoveries require large surveys that cover a signiﬁcant fraction of the sky. The\\nsecond challenge is often referred to as “ﬁnding needles in a haystack”. Most high-redshift\\nquasar surveys are based on Lyman break dropout selections using optical and NIR pho-\\ntometric survey data. However, other populations of celestial objects, in particular cool\\ngalactic dwarfs with spectral types M, L and T (usually referred as MLTs) and compact\\n4 Fan et al.\\nearly-type intermediate-redshift galaxies, have similar optical and NIR colors. Barnett et al.\\n(2019) show that these contaminant populations outnumber z∼7 quasars by 2–4 orders of\\nmagnitude in deep photometric surveys. A number of photometric selection techniques have\\nbeen developed, and the choices of how to apply these techniques require careful consider-\\nation of the balance between selection eﬃciency and completeness. Finally, spectroscopic\\nidentiﬁcations of candidate quasars require observations on large aperture telescopes. Until\\nrecently, such observations were only possible with single-object spectroscopy because the\\nlow spatial density of high-redshift quasars. The demand of telescope resources for discovery\\ndrives the need for both high selection eﬃciency and sometimes special observing strategies.\\nFor example, Wang et al. (2017) improved spectroscopic identiﬁcation eﬃciency by using\\nlow-resolution ( R∼300) long-slit NIR spectroscopy, which could capture the prominent\\nLyman break features in the quasar spectra and reject contaminants with shorter exposure\\nthan higher resolution spectra, which is more common for quasar spectroscopy followup\\nwork, would require.\\n5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5\\nRedshift−28\\n−26\\n−24\\n−22\\n−20M1450(UV magnitude)\\n2019≤year≤2022\\n2016≤year<2019\\n2000≤year<2016\\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2020\\nYear0200400600z≥5.3 quasarsTotal = 531\\nFigure 1\\nDistribution of all known z≥5.3 quasars in the absolute magnitude-redshift plane (top panel).\\nThe shaded areas are the parameter space probed by selected large quasar survey programs.

The intrinsic spectra of quasars\\n(Fig 5) in the rest-frame UV and optical are characterized by a blue power-law continuum\\nand a number of strong broad emission lines. At z >3, the strong IGM neutral hydrogen\\n(HI) absorption from Lyman series lines and Lyman continuum redshifts into the observed\\noptical wavelength. Thus high-redshift quasars are “dropout” objects with a strong Lyman\\nbreak with the dropout bands correspond to the observed wavelength of the Lyman break.\\nAt longer wavelength, quasars have blue broad-band colors due to their power law contin-\\nuum. The Lyman dropout selection method for quasars has been used since the discoveries\\nof the ﬁrstz>4 quasars (Warren et al. 1987). A more recent development is the inclusion\\nof mid-IR (MIR) photometric surveys in the candidate selection (e.g. Wu et al. 2015). The\\nlong wavelength baseline from NIR to MIR, in particular using the WISE (Wright et al.\\n2010) data, allows more eﬀective separation of high-redshift quasars and MLT dwarfs by\\ncolors.\\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\\ny−J0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5J−W1\\n6.06.5 7.0 7.2\\nML\\nT\\nFigure 2\\nExample of y −J vs. J −W1 color-color diagram used for high-redshift quasar selections.

(2019).\\nFig. 2 illustrates how to use the combination of optical and IR colors to select z >6.5\\nquasars. At z∼6.5, the strong Ly αemission line is in the yband. At higher redshift, this\\nband starts to be dominated by IGM absorption and quasars become “y-dropouts” with\\nincreasing red y−Jcolors. Meanwhile, the J−W1 color is determined by the quasar power\\nlaw continuum and has a near constant value, which is redder than most of the sub/stellar\\nobjects with spectral types earlier than L. The main contaminants for this redshift range\\nare L and T dwarfs.\\nInayoshi et al. (2020) presented a summary table of the photometric surveys used in\\nthe discoveries of z >6 quasars in the past ﬁfteen years. Early surveys such as SDSS and\\nPS1 (Chambers et al. 2016) used 2–4 meter class telescopes with relatively short exposure\\n6 Fan et al.\\ntimes, thus they are optimized to discover rare, luminous quasars in large sky areas. Se-\\nlection of fainter quasars requires photometric observations on large aperture telescopes:\\nthe SHELLQs project (Matsuoka et al. 2022) is based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)\\nsurvey on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope (Aihara et al. 2018). As shown in Fig 2, at z >7,\\nquasars begin to drop out in the yband at the red limit of CCD detector sensitivities.\\nThe discovery of quasars at this redshift requires the combination of wide-ﬁeld IR surveys\\nthat provide detection of the quasar rest-frame UV continuum, and deep optical surveys\\nthat sample the strong Lyman break. Following the ﬁrst quasar discovery at z >7 using\\nphotometric data from the UKIDSS survey (Mortlock et al. 2011), there have been eight\\nquasars published at z >7 (see Table 1). The current redshift frontier is represented by\\nthe three luminous quasars known at z>7.5, selected using a combination of NIR, optical,\\nand MIR (WISE) surveys: J1342+0928 at z= 7.54 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2018); J1007+2115\\natz= 7.52 (“P¯ oniu¯ a’ena”, Yang et al. 2020b); and J0313-1806 at z= 7.64 (Wang et al.\\n2021b).\\n2.2. Optimization of Photometric Selection of High-Redshift Quasars\\nThe vast majority of high-redshift quasars have been discovered using color selection. The\\nmost commonly used method is to implement a series of “color cuts”: select objects that\\nmeet a set of criteria in the ﬂux/ﬂux-error space (usually referred to as the “color space”) as\\nhigh-redshift quasar candidates. These cuts are often initially guided by a combination of\\nphotometry of existing high-redshift quasars and simulated colors based on synthetic quasar\\nspectra, as well as observed and simulated data of the contaminant populations. These cuts\\nare reﬁned as surveys progress with larger training sets and better understanding of the\\ncontaminant populations. Fan (1999) presented an early example of color space simulation\\nof diﬀerent populations of objects with compact morphology (quasars, normal stars, white\\ndwarfs and compact galaxies) in the SDSS photometric system. This simulation was used\\nto formulate color selections for both the SDSS main spectroscopic survey (Richards et al.\\n2002) and selections of z∼6 quasars (Fan et al. 2001). Works such as Hewett et al. (2006),\\nMcGreer et al. (2013), Barnett et al. (2019), and Temple et al. (2021) expanded these\\nsimulations by including more realistic quasar population models and models of MLT and\\nintermediate-redshift galaxies, extending to higher redshifts, and including NIR and MIR\\nphotometric bands.\\nHigh-redshift surveys based on SDSS (e.g., Jiang et al. 2016), PS1 (e.g., Ba˜ nados et al.\\n2016) as well as works using the DESI Legacy Survey (e.g., Wang et al. 2019) used color\\ncuts as their primary selection method. The color cut method is simple to implement, and\\nhas high selection completeness even for objects that have unusual spectral features such\\nas broad absorption lines (BALs), weak emission lines or those with modest reddening,\\nbecause the color cuts are usually fairly loose and cover a large portion of color space, and\\nthe strong Lyman break is not strongly aﬀected by the intrinsic quasar SEDs. On the\\nother hand, because all candidates that satisfy the cuts are selected without considering\\nthe relative density distribution of the targeted (quasar) population and the contaminant\\npopulations (primary MLTs and compact galaxies), or how the candidate SEDs match the\\nquasar template, color cut selection tends to have a higher contamination rate. For example,\\nWang et al. (2019) ﬁnd a 30% spectroscopic success rate when searching for z>6.5 quasars.\\nThe contamination grows signiﬁcantly worse for z∼7.5 (F. Wang, private communication).\\nA number of techniques have been applied to improve the eﬃciency of color selection.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 7\\nThese improvements are especially important for quasars at the highest redshift ( z>6.5),\\nwhere quasars are increasingly rare compared to the contaminant populations, and at fainter\\nﬂuxes for which increasing photometric errors results in more contaminants scatter into the\\nselected area in color space. Mortlock et al. (2012) ﬁrst introduced a selection algorithm\\nbased on Bayesian model comparison (BMC). In BMC, the posterior quasar probability for\\na given object with survey photometry dis given by :\\nPq=p(q|d) =Wq(d)\\nWq(d) +Wb(d) +Wg(d), 1.\\nwhere q, b, and g represent quasar, brown dwarf (MLTs), and galaxy populations, re-\\nspectively. The weights W for each population are calculated using a population model\\nthat describes its surface density distribution integrated over a Gaussian likelihood func-\\ntion based on model colors. BMC wss applied by Mortlock et al. (2011) to data from the\\nUKIDSS survey to identify the ﬁrst quasar at z>7. The SHELLQs survey (Matsuoka et al.\\n2022) used BMC to select faint quasars in the HSC survey with great success in achieving\\na high spectroscopic identiﬁcation rate ( ∼75%) even at the low-luminosity end at z∼6.\\nWagenveld et al. (2022) presented a similar probabilistic approach that also includes radio\\ndata in the selection.\\nReed et al. (2017) applied a SED ﬁtting method for high-redshift quasar selection. In\\nthis method, after the initial color cuts, reduced χ2values are calculated for each candidate,\\nmatching the observed colors of the candidate observed SEDs to a series of model SEDs,\\nincluding diﬀerent MLT spectral types as well as early type galaxies at various redshifts.\\nObjects with high reduced χ2for the contaminant populations, and low values for the\\nquasar SED models are selected as quasar candidates.\\nBarnett et al. (2021) presented a detailed comparison study of diﬀerent selection tech-\\nniques in searching for z >6.5 quasars using VIKING survey data. They show that BMC\\nis highly complete in recovering previously known quasars in the survey area, and at the\\nsame time eﬀectively rejects conﬁrmed contaminants. Using simulations, they calculate the\\nsurvey selection function – completeness as a function of quasar redshift and luminosity, and\\nﬁnd that both BMC and the SED method represent a signiﬁcant improvement in selection\\ncompleteness and depth compared to simple color cuts.\\nWenzl et al. (2021) used a random forest supervised machine learning method to select\\nz>5 quasars from PS1 data with high eﬃciency. Nanni et al. (2022) proposed an alternative\\nprobabilistic approach, in which the density of the contaminant populations in color space\\nis modeled as Gaussian mixtures based on observed photometric data and calculated using\\nthe extreme deconvolution technique, instead of using simulated population models.\\nHigh-redshift quasar selection can also be considered in the context of supervised ma-\\nchine learning. The training sets of existing objects are small, and in most case are subject\\nto the bias of previously selected samples or extrapolations from low-redshift populations.\\nThe choice of high-redshift quasar selection algorithm in a given survey is a tradeoﬀ be-\\ntween completeness and eﬃciency. Selections that rely on SED and contaminant population\\nmodels run the risk of missing objects that are highly valuable but have unusual properties.\\nAn example is the discovery of J0100+2802, the most luminous unlensed quasar currently\\nknown atz >5 (Wu et al. 2015). The object was assigned as low priority in the original\\nSDSS survey due to its relatively red color and bright apparently magnitude, indicating\\nhigh probability of it being a brown dwarf. It is not surprising that record-breaking discov-\\nery is made often – but not always (e.g., Mortlock et al. 2011) – using the less restrictive\\n8 Fan et al.\\ncolor-cut method, and probabilistic methods are more eﬀective once a large training set has\\nbeen established.\\nIf high-redshift quasar candidates could be part of the overall target selection in a large\\nautomated spectroscopic survey program, then the color selection could be relaxed to be\\nmore complete and less sensitive to templates or model assumptions, because high-redshift\\nquasar candidates are rare and are thus only a small fraction of the total targets. The\\nSDSS main quasar survey (Richards et al. 2002) targeted quasars up to z∼5.4. The Dark\\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI, Abareshi et al. 2022) is using spectrographs with\\n5000 ﬁbers on the 4-m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak to conduct a 5-year spectroscopic\\nsurvey of∼40 million galaxies, quasars and stars. DESI is expected to more than double\\nthe number of quasars known at z>5 when completed. A similar survey is being planned\\nfor the 4MOST project (Merloni 2019).\\nOther established quasar selection methods include variability, astrometry (i.e., lack of\\nproper motion; Lang et al. 2009), detections in X-ray and radio wavelengths, MIR colors,\\nas well as wide-ﬁeld slitless spectroscopy. Except for the last method (e.g., Schneider et al.\\n1989, 1999), most selection methods are not sensitive to the quasar redshifts. Therefore,\\nsome color cuts are usually used to identify high-redshift quasar candidates. McGreer\\net al. (2006) and Zeimann et al. (2011) report the ﬁrst discoveries of radio-loud z > 6\\nquasars by matching radio surveys such as FIRST with optical photometric surveys. X-ray\\nobservations provide fundamental probes of AGN evolution across cosmic time. New wide-\\nﬁeld X-ray surveys such as e-ROSITA (Wolf et al. 2021) will enable selections of luminous\\nX-ray quasars at the highest redshifts. We will discuss the X-ray and radio properties of\\nhigh-redshift quasars in Sec 3.2.\\n2.3. A Database of z>5.3Quasars\\nAt the time of this review, there are 531 z≥5.3 quasars in the published literature.\\nWe present their spectra in Fig 3. The locations of the z≥5.3 quasars on the redshift-\\nluminosity plane is shown in Fig 1. We include a database with their basic properties\\nin the Supplementary Material associated with this review (follow the Supplemental\\nMaterial link from the Annual Reviews home page at http://www.annualreviews.org).\\nTo be included in this database, we require the object to : (1) have a spectroscopically\\nconﬁrmed redshift z≥5.3; we do not include objects with only photometric redshifts;\\n(2) have at least one broad emission line (FWHM >2000 km s−1) in the rest-frame UV;\\nwe do not include narrow-line (Type-2) quasars or obscured AGN at high redshift. In\\naddition to the quasar name, coordinates, redshift and references, the database also include\\nmeasurements of the quasar’s continuum luminosity at the rest-frame 1450 ˚A and 3000 ˚A,\\nproperties of the Mg iiemission line, and BH mass derived from Mg iimeasurements quoted\\nin the literature, estimated using Equation 4. We only consider Mg iimeasurements for\\nquasars atz>5.9, as Mg iilines are usually in regions highly aﬀected by telluric absorption\\nin the NIR at lower redshift.\\nThe high-redshift quasar database includes 275 objects at z >6 and 8 at z >7. At\\nthe time of writing, there are 113 z>5.9 quasars with robust Mg ii-based black hole mass\\nestimates. We list the properties of quasars currently known at z > 7 in Table 1. This\\ndatabase expands the compilation in the Supplementary Material of Inayoshi et al.

Future Quasar Surveys\\nNew surveys are on the horizon to further expand the quasar redshift frontier. The Legacy\\nSurvey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will cover the southern\\nsky at optical wavelengths to unprecedented depths. LSST will reach 5 σco-added depths in\\nthezandybands at 25−26 mag level in 5-10 years (Ivezi´ c et al. 2019), allowing selections of\\nseveral thousand quasars and AGN at z∼6−7.5 using both color and variablity selection\\nmethods, while providing deep photometry in the dropout bands for selection of z > 7\\nquasars. ESA’s Euclid mission will provide deep near-IR photometry not possible with\\nground-based observations. It will cover 15,000 deg2of the sky to a 5 σdepth of 24 mag in\\nY, J and H bands (Scaramella et al. 2022), enabling selection of quasar candidates up to\\nz∼10. Barnett et al. (2019) predicted that Euclid + LSST will allow discoveries of ∼25\\nquasars atz>7.5, including∼8 beyondz>8, although the exact yields strongly depend\\non the assumed evolution of quasar luminosity function. Further in the future is NASA’s\\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will cover a smaller area in its High Latitude\\nSurvey but reaching about two magnitude deeper.\\nFan et al. (2019a) show that by extrapolating the current measurement of the quasar\\nluminosity function, there will be only one “SDSS”-like quasar ( M1450<−26, powered by\\nbillion-M⊙SMBH) over the entire observable universe at z>9. The combination of LSST,\\nEuclid and Roman will allow the discovery of the earliest luminous quasars in the Universe.\\nHowever, in addition to the challenges of their selection (Barnett et al. 2019, Nanni et al.\\n2022), their spectroscopic identiﬁcation will require IR spectrographs more powerful than\\nthose with the current ground-based telescopes: 30m-class extremely large telescopes and\\nJWST will be the primary tools for their conﬁrmation and follow-up observations.\\n3. AN EVOLVING QUASAR POPULATION\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst review the evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at high\\nredshift, which directly constrains the growth history of early SMBHs (Sec 3.1). The number\\ndensity of quasars is found to decline rapidly towards high redshift, in sharp constrast to\\nthe lack of strong evolution in the SEDs of quasars (Sec 3.2), from X-ray to radio, and in\\nparticular in the rest-frame UV to NIR, at which the quasar SED peaks, although a number\\nof sub-types of quasars appear to be more common at z>5−6.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 11\\n3.1. Evolution of Quasar Luminosity Function\\nSoon after the initial discovery of quasars, Schmidt (1968) found that their density rises\\nsharply with redshift up to z≳2. Wide-ﬁeld surveys such as 2dF (Boyle et al. 2000) and\\nSDSS (Richards et al. 2006b) established that the density of luminous quasars peaks at\\nz∼2−3. Osmer (1982) presented the ﬁrst evidence that quasar density at z>3.5 appears\\nto be declining. Schmidt et al. (1995) characterized this decline as an exponential function\\nwith redshift:\\nρ(z)∝10kz, 2.\\nwherekis measured to be ∼−0.5 atz∼3−5. The shape of the QLF is usually described\\nas a double, or broken, power law:\\nΦ(M1450,z) =Φ∗(z)\\n100.4(α+1)(M1450−M∗\\n1450)+ 100.4(β+1)(M1450−M∗\\n1450)3.\\nwhereM1450is the absolute magnitude of the quasar continuum at rest-frame 1450 ˚A,αand\\nβare the faint-end and bright-end slopes, respectively, M∗\\n1450is the characteristic absolute\\nmagnitude or break magnitude measured at 1450 ˚A, and Φ∗is the normalization of the LF\\nwhich has an exponential decline described in Eq. 2.\\nEarly high-redshift surveys such as the SDSS were only sensitive to the most luminous\\nquasars. Based on a sample of nine SDSS quasars at z >5.7, Fan et al. (2004) found that\\natz∼6, the co-moving spatial density of quasars with M1450<−26.7 is 6×10−10Mpc−3,\\nconsistent with extrapolation from lower redshift trends. Jiang et al. (2009) extended the\\nSDSS quasar survey to the “stripe 82” region, reaching two magnitudes deeper than the\\nSDSS main survey. They found a bright end slope βbetween –2.6 and –3.1. Willott et al.\\n(2010) combined the faint quasars discovered in the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey\\n(CFHQS) with the brighter SDSS quasars, and presented the ﬁrst measurement of QLF at\\nz∼6 using a sample of 40 quasars. They found a bright end slope β=−2.81 and a break\\nmagnitude M∗\\n1450=−25.1; the faint end slope was still poorly constrained at this redshift.\\nJiang et al. (2016) presented the ﬁnal results of the z∼6 quasar survey in the SDSS\\nfootprint. Using this sample of 52 quasar at 5 .7<z< 6.4, they found a bright end slope of\\nβ=−2.8±0.2. In addition, they found a density evolution with the exponential evolution\\nparameter k=−0.72±0.11, a signiﬁcantly steeper slope than the value at z∼3−5,\\nsuggesting an accelerated evolution of luminous quasars between z∼5 and 6.\\nThe SHELLQs project (Matsuoka et al. 2016) extended the z∼6 quasar sample to\\nsigniﬁcantly lower luminosity. Matsuoka et al. (2018) presented measurements of the QLF\\ndown toM1450∼ −22, which is well ﬁt with a double power law that has a faint-end\\nslopeα=−1.23+0.44\\n−0.34, a bright-end slope β=−2.73+0.23\\n−0.31, and a break magnitude M∗\\n1450=\\n−24.90+0.75\\n−0.90. Their measured QLF showed a strong break and a signiﬁcant ﬂattening at\\nthe faint end at z∼6. Schindler et al. (2022) used the combination of the bright PS1\\nquasar sample that includes 125 quasars at z∼5.7−6.2 with the fainter quasars from\\nSHELLQs for a new QLF measurement at z∼6. They found a steeper bright-end slope\\nofβ=−3.84+0.63\\n−1.21, as well as a steeper faint-end slope of α=−1.70+0.29\\n−0.19, with a bright\\nbreak magnitude of M∗\\n1450=−26.38+0.79\\n−0.60. Their study yields a constant redshift evolution\\nofk∼−0.7 over a wide redshift range of z= 4−7.\\nMeasurement of the QLF becomes increasingly diﬃcult at higher redshift due to the\\nrapid decline in spatial density of quasars. Wang et al. (2019) conducted the ﬁrst mea-\\nsurement of the QLF at redshift approaching seven based on a sample of 17 quasars at\\n12 Fan et al.\\n6.45< z < 7.05 (see also Venemans et al. 2013). They found a quasar spatial comoving\\ndensity ofρ(M1450<−26) = 0.39±0.11Gpc−3atz∼6.7, and an exponential density evo-\\nlution parameter k=−0.78±0.18. The density of luminous quasars declines by a factor of\\n∼6 per unit redshift. The e-folding time of quasar density evolution and that of black hole\\naccretion (Sec 4) become comparable, underlying the strong constraints quasar evolution\\ncould place on the SMBH accretion mode.\\n−28−26−24−22\\nM1450(mag)0.0010.0100.1001.00010.000Φ(M1450,z) (Gpc−3mag−1)\\nJiang + 2016\\nMatsuoka+2018\\nSchindler+2022\\nWillott + 2010\\nJiang + 2016\\nMatsuoka+2018\\nSchindler+2022\\n(binned)\\n2 4 6\\nRedshift100101102n(M1450<−26,z) (cGpc−3)Kulkarni + 2019\\nk=−0.7\\nk=−0.78\\nGiallongo + 2019\\nMatsuoka + 2018\\nJiang + 2016\\nWang + 2019\\nSchindler+2022\\n6.0 6.5 7.00.250.500.751.001.251.501.75\\nFigure 4\\nQuasar luminosity function measurements at high-redshift.

(2022).\\nFig 4 (right panel) illustrates the overall density evolution of luminous ( M1450<−26)\\nquasars with measurements from various surveys at z= 3−7. While a strong exponential\\ndecline in the comoving spatial density of luminous quasars has been well established,\\nthere are still signiﬁcant uncertainties in the evolution of the shape of the QLF (Fig 4,\\nleft panel). As discussed in Schindler et al. (2022), the bright-end slope determination is\\nstrongly inﬂuenced by small number statistics. At the faint end, selection incompleteness\\ncould be a signiﬁcant factor when a completeness correction of ≳2 is often needed.\\nThere have been a number of ambitious eﬀorts to combine QLF measurements across\\nthe electromagnetic spectrum and diﬀerent cosmic epochs to obtain a complete picture\\nof quasar/AGN evolution from reionization to the current epoch. Hopkins et al. (2007)\\npresented the bolometric QLF up to z∼6. They explicitly modeled the X-ray column den-\\nsity distribution and SED shape variation of quasars to allow determinations of bolometric\\nluminosities of high-redshift populations. Kulkarni et al. (2019) constructed a sample of\\nmore than 80,000 color-selected quasars and AGN with a homogeneous treatment of survey\\nselection eﬀects, and derived the AGN UV luminosity function from z= 0 to 7.5. Their\\nmeasurement suggested a continued steeping of the faint end slope βand a brightening of\\nthe break magnitude. Shen et al. (2020) updated the early Hopkins et al. work. They\\nfound bolometric QLF evolution consistent with those based on UV-selected samples alone,\\nand concluded that the faint-end slope measurement is still uncertain at high-redshift.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 13\\nFor the purpose of comparison with theoretical models or making predictions of future\\nsurveys, we suggest using the combined QLF measurements presented in Kulkarni et al.\\n(2019) or Shen et al. (2020) for z≲6, where the QLF is well measured over a wide range of\\nluminosity. At z≳6, the uncertainty is still large for both the QLF shape and its redshift\\nevolution; Schindler et al. (2022) presented the most up-to-date measurements.\\nA key limitation of current high-redshift quasar surveys is that the quasar selection\\nmethods assume a blue power-law continuum in the rest-frame UV. It is possible that\\ncurrent surveys are missing signiﬁcant number of red or reddened quasars. Kato et al. (2020)\\nreported the discovery of two dust-reddened quasars at z > 5.6 in the SHELLQs survey\\nbased on their mid-IR WISE detection. Endsley et al. (2022) discovered an obscured radio-\\nloud AGN at z= 6.85 in the 1.5 deg2COSMOS ﬁeld with bolometric luminosity comparable\\nto that of luminous SDSS z∼6 quasars. Ni et al. (2020) studied the obscuration of high\\nredshift quasars using the BLUETIDES simulation, and predicted that the dust-extincted\\nUV LF is about 1.5 dex lower than the intrinsic LF, and the vast majority of z∼7 AGNs\\nhave been missed by UV-based surveys due to dust extinction. This would imply a much\\nhigher bolometric luminosity density of early quasars, and would have a profound impact\\non the growth of SMBHs and early galaxy evolution overall. A reliable determination of the\\nobscured fraction of quasars at z≳5 needs a combination of wide-ﬁeld deep X-ray survey\\nand eﬀective spectroscopic identiﬁcation of faint, obscured sources with either JWST or\\nNOEMA/ALMA.\\n3.2. (A Lack of) Evolution of the Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions\\nHigh-redshift galaxies have intrinsic blue SEDs that are dominated by young stellar popu-\\nlations. Metallicity, or chemical abundance, in their ISM has also been shown to be lower\\nthan in low-redshift galaxies (Stark 2016). However, the overall SEDs and the chemical\\nabundance in quasar broad line regions (BLRs) do not evolve signiﬁcantly with redshift, al-\\nthough quasar density decreases drastically at high-redshift. This apparent lack of spectral\\nevolution in the UV properties of quasars were noticed as soon as the ﬁrst z∼6 quasars\\nwere discovered (e.g., Barth et al. 2003, Fan et al. 2004, Iwamuro et al. 2004, Jiang et al.\\n2007). Shen et al. (2019) conducted an optical/NIR spectroscopic survey of 50 quasars at\\nz >5.7. Their observations covered the wavelength range from the Ly αto Mg iiemission\\nlines. Yang et al. (2021) presented a spectroscopic survey of 34 quasars at 6 .3< z < 7.6,\\ncovering a similar wavelength range. Both papers presented composite rest-frame UV spec-\\ntra of their high-redshift samples. Fig 5 compares the quasar composite spectra at z∼6−7\\nwith the standard low-redshift SDSS quasar composite from Vanden Berk et al. (2001). The\\naverage continuum slope and emission line strength/width do not evolve signiﬁcantly with\\nredshift, with the exception of a weaker and blueshifted C ivemission line (see discussion\\nin Sec 5.4).\\nBroad emission line ratios in quasars have been used to constrain metallicities in the\\nquasar BLR. Jiang et al. (2007) and De Rosa et al. (2014) studied emission line ratios in a\\nseries of UV lines, and found no evidence of evolution from lower redshift samples, with the\\ngas metallicity a few times solar based on photoionization modeling. This is conﬁrmed by\\nstudies using high S/N spectroscopy from the XQR30 survey ( https://xqr30.inaf.it/ )\\nof quasars at z= 5.8−7.5 (Lai et al. 2022). The line ratio of Fe ii/Mg iiis of particular\\ninterest, because of the diﬀerent enrichment histories of these two lines – Mg is an α-\\nelement predominately produced by core-collapse supernovae, while Fe is mainly from Type-\\n14 Fan et al.\\n1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250 2500 2750 3000\\nRest Frame Wavelength012345FλYang+2021\\nVanden Berk+ 2001\\nShen+2019\\n1500 16001.01.52.0Civ\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\\nRedshift05101520FFeII/FMgII\\nYang+2021\\nSchindler+2020Mazzucchelli+2017\\nDeRosa+2011Maiolino+2003\\nShin+2019Onoue+2020\\nIwamuro+2002\\nFigure 5\\nUpper panel: Quasar composite spectrum (red solid line) from Yang et al.

Schindler et al. (2020) carried out detailed modeling of Fe iiand\\nMgiilines using a large sample of quasar spectra from VLT/Xshooter, and compared their\\nmeasurements with those in the literature. There is no evidence of evolution in the Fe/Mg\\nratio up to the highest redshift, although scatter is large at any given redshift (Fig 5). The\\nlack of spectral evolution in quasar rest-frame UV spectra, especially in the emission line\\nproperties, indicates that quasar BLRs are chemically enriched very rapidly, within the ﬁrst\\nfew hundred million years after the initial star formation in the host galaxy. This is not\\nsurprising, as we will review in Sec 5: quasar host galaxies are sites of the most intense star\\nformation in the early universe.\\nHowever, there are a few noticeable evolutionary trends in quasars at cosmic dawn that\\ncould be related to the early phase of quasar growth. In Sec 5.4, we discuss an increasing\\nfraction of quasars with strongly blue-shifted high ionization UV emission lines and with\\nstrong BAL features as evidence for early quasar feedback. In Sec 6.3.1, we present the\\ndiscovery of z∼6 quasars with IGM absorption features indicative of very young ages.\\nA subset of high-redshift SDSS quasars have much weaker UV emission lines, in par-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 15\\nticular Lyαand C iv. Diamond-Stanic et al. (2009) identiﬁed them as >3σoutliers in the\\nquasar emission line strength distributions. They represent ∼1% of quasar population at\\nz<4, after correction for selection incompleteness (Diamond-Stanic et al. 2009). Ba˜ nados\\net al. (2016) showed that this fraction increases to ∼14% among z>5.6 PS1 quasars based\\non Lyαmeasurements. Shen et al. (2019) found a similar fraction using C ivmeasurements.\\nIt remains unclear whether weak line quasars are related to the young age or high accretion\\nrate in the high-redshift quasar population (Plotkin et al. 2015)..\\nX-ray emission originates from the accretion disk and surrounding hot corona close to\\nthe central SMBH, and provides crucial information about black hole accretion and AGN\\nfeedback (Fabian 2012). Brandt et al. (2001) detected the ﬁrst z∼6 quasar in X-rays using\\nthe XMM/Newton telescope. More than 30 quasar at z≳6 have now been detected in\\nX-rays, using either the Chandra or XMM-Newton telescopes. Nanni et al. (2017) analyzed\\n29 quasars at z >5.5 with X-ray detections. They found a mean X-ray power-law photon\\nindex of Γ∼1.9, similar to that at low redshift. The optical-X-ray spectral slopes of the\\nhigh-redshift also follow the relation established at low redshift. Vito et al. (2019a) carried\\nout a similar analysis, and found a slightly steeper X-ray power-law index, consistent with\\na generally higher Eddington ratio among SMBHs in these quasars at z >6. Wang et al.\\n(2021a) extended the X-ray analysis to quasars at z∼7 (see also Pons et al. 2020). They\\nalso found a steepening of X-ray spectra with Γ ∼2.3. The optical-X-ray power-law slope,\\nαOX, traces the relative importance of the accretion disk and corono emission in quasars\\nand AGN. At low redshift, there is a tight correlation between αOXand the quasar UV\\nluminosity (e.g. Just et al. 2007). There is no evolution in this correlation up to z∼7\\n(e.g. Wang et al. 2021a). The X-ray observations show a consistent picture that the inner\\naccretion-disk and hot-corona structure in quasars was established at the highest redshift\\nwith minimal evolution in their properties across cosmic time.\\nAt rest-frame NIR and MIR wavelengths, the radiation from quasars is dominated by\\nreprocessed emission from the hot dust component beyond the accretion disk structure (see\\nreview by Lyu & Rieke 2022). At the highest redshift, dust observations (at rest-frame\\n>1.5µm) have been largely limited to photometric observations of bright sources using the\\nSpitzer (e.g., Jiang et al. 2006) and Herschel (Leipski et al. 2014) Telescopes, although this\\nwill change with the launch of JWST. These observations also showed a lack of evolution:\\nthe average IR-SEDs of quasars at z∼5−6 are consistent with low-redshift templates\\nand the hot dust structure is already in place by z∼6. Jiang et al. (2010) reported the\\ndetection of two quasars at z∼6 with weak hot dust emissions using Spitzer. Later studies\\nsuggested that these dust-deﬁcient quasars are not unique to z > 6, and examples with\\nsimilar SEDs are found even in the low-redshift PG sample (e.g. Lyu et al. 2017).\\nQuasars were initially discovered as point-like sources emitting strong radio emissions\\n(Schmidt 1963). However, the fraction of quasars that exhibit strong jet-powered radio\\nemission (radio-loud quasars) is around 10% with no signiﬁcant dependence on redshift,\\nat least up to z∼6 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2021, Gloudemans et al. 2021). The\\nhighest redshift radio-loud quasar known is at z= 6.82 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2021), and the\\nhighest redshift blazar is at z= 6.10 (Belladitta et al. 2020). It is still debated whether\\nthe seemingly constant radio-loud fraction is due to two intrinsically diﬀerent populations\\nof quasars or is a consequence of the duty cycle of jet emission during the life of a quasar.\\nIf the latter were the case, one should expect an increase in the radio-loud fraction at the\\nhighest redshifts (where the available time for a quasar shortens), something we have not\\nyet witnessed and depends on the lifetime of the radio-loud phase.\\n16 Fan et al.\\nThe lack of evolution in the radio-loud fraction discussed above concerns the compact\\ncore radio emission. However, there is an important evolution with redshift if we focus\\non the extended radio emission: the lack of giant ( ∼100s kpc) radio lobes at z >4, which\\nare common at lower redshifts (Fabian et al. 2014). Indeed, the most extended radio jet\\nknown atz∼6 is<2 kpc (Momjian et al. 2018). A plausible physical explanation is\\nthat atz >4, the CMB energy density [ ∝(1 +z)4] exceeds the magnetic energy density\\nin radio lobes. In that case, inverse Compton (IC) scattering losses will make any large\\nlobes at high redshift radio weak and X-ray bright (Ghisellini et al. 2014). The IC/CMB\\neﬀect has been challenging to probe with current X-ray telescopes. Recent deep Chandra\\nX-ray observations of the two z∼6 quasars with the most extended radio jets resulted in\\ntentative evidence of larger X-ray jets (Connor et al. 2021, Ighina et al. 2022). Obtaining\\nthis marginal evidence was expensive, even for our most powerful X-ray telescopes observing\\nthe best existing targets to test this eﬀect. To robustly measure the IC/CMB eﬀect in a\\nsample of radio-loud quasars, we will likely need to wait for the next generation of X-ray\\ntelescopes.\\nThe discussions in this subsection present a picture that on average, the intrinsic SED of\\nquasars at the highest redshift, with emission from the accretion disk (X-ray, UV/optical),\\nbroad emission line regions, hot dust, and radio jets, show little evolution from their low-\\nredshift counterparts. The AGN structure is already in place and fully formed up to the\\nhighest redshift we have observed to date.\\nJWST will enable detailed studies of the physical properties of high-redshift quasars\\nin the rest-frame optical and IR wavelengths which are not possible from the ground. It\\nwill be especially interesting to see if the dust component of the quasar population shows\\nany evolution, since dust production mechanism (e.g. Maiolino et al. 2004) and the ISM\\nconditions in the host galaxies are likely diﬀerent in early epochs. X-ray observations with\\nChandra and XMM of even the most luminous quasars at cosmic dawn can only yield a\\nsmall number of photons. Future X-ray missions (e.g. Martocchia et al. 2017) could allow\\nallow high S/N spectroscopic observations of early quasars to characterize their accretion\\nproperties (including BH spin) and X-ray obscuration.\\n4. GROWTH OF SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES IN THE FIRST BILLION\\nYEARS\\nSMBHs are thought to be ubiquitous in the centers of massive galaxies, but their formation\\nmechanism is still an outstanding question in astrophysics. Since the discovery of quasars\\natz≳6 (Fan et al. 2001), the formation and growth of SMBHs have become even more\\nintriguing and challenging to explain. In this section we will ﬁrst review the current methods\\nused to measure the BH masses at high redshift (Section 4.1), then give an overview of the\\nproperties of the observed population (Section 4.2), and the implications for early BH seeds\\nand growth (Section 4.3). Finally, we will brieﬂy describe additional methods that in the\\nnear future can be used to improve current BH mass estimates at high redshift (Section 4.4).\\n4.1. Black Hole Mass Measurements in High-redshift quasars\\nThe spectra of z≳6 quasars show the typical signatures of broad (FWHM of thousands\\nkm s−1) emission lines that are superimposed on the power-law continuum emission of the\\nquasar’s accretion disk. These broad lines are thought to emerge from a region very close\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 17\\nto the accreting BH (so-called the “broad-line region”) and thus provide a unique tool to\\nconstrain the properties of the central BH. The size of the broad-line region scales with the\\nquasar luminosity, and the width of the lines is a measure of the potential depth (Peterson\\net al. 2004). Thus, a single-epoch spectrum gives enough information to estimate the mass\\nof the central accreting BH (Vestergaard & Osmer 2009).\\nOne of the most reliable estimators of BH mass and Eddington ratio is the H βline (e.g.,\\nPark et al. 2012). At z >6, Hβis shifted to the MIR and is thus not accessible from the\\nground. As an alternative, the C ivλ1549 and Mg iiλ2800 lines have been extensively used\\nto measure BH masses of quasars at these redshifts (e.g., De Rosa et al. 2014, Farina et al.\\n2022). Estimates based on the high ionization C ivline are uncertain, as this line shows large\\nvelocity oﬀsets, implying signiﬁcant non-virialized motions (Mej´ ıa-Restrepo et al. 2018, Park\\net al. 2017). Moreover, there is mounting evidence that large C ivblueshifts (>2000 km s−1)\\nare more common at z>6 than at lower redshifts (e.g., Meyer et al. 2019, Schindler et al.\\n2020, see also Section 5.4). Therefore, in this review, we only focus on results based on\\nMgiimeasurements, which are thought to be the most reliable until H β-derived masses are\\npossible (Bahk et al. 2019; see Section 4.4).\\nOne of the most widely used relations for BH mass estimation in high-redshift quasars\\nis:\\nMBH= 106.86[FWHM(Mg ii)\\n1000 km s−1]2[L3000\\n1044erg s−1]0.5\\nM⊙, 4.\\nwhere FWHM(Mg ii) is the Full Width at Half Maximum of the Mg iiline, and L3000\\nis the luminosity at 3000 ˚A. Vestergaard & Osmer (2009) presented the scaling relation\\nfrom Equation 4. The intrinsic scatter in the relation is 0.55 dex, which dominates the\\nuncertainty for individual measurements.\\nThe theoretical maximum luminosity that a source can achieve when the gravitational\\nand radiation forces are in equilibrium is called the Eddington luminosity (Eddington 1926).\\nThe Eddington luminosity for pure ionized hydrogen in spherical symmetry is deﬁned as\\nLEdd=4πcGmpMBH\\nσT5.\\n= 1.26×1038erg s−1(MBH\\nM⊙)\\nwherecis the speed of light, Gis the gravitational constant, mpis the mass of a proton,\\nandσTis the Thomson scattering cross-section. The ratio between the bolometric and\\nEddington luminosities (referred to as Eddington ratio; λEdd=LBol/LEdd) is useful to\\nassess the quasar population’s accretion properties. While several bolometric corrections\\nare published in the literature (e.g., Runnoe et al. 2012, Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012, Duras\\net al. 2020), in this review (e.g., in Fig. 6), we adopt the bolometric correction ﬁrst presented\\nby Richards et al. (2006a) and used in several studies of high-redshift quasars (e.g., Shen\\net al. 2011, Yang et al. 2021, Farina et al. 2022):\\nLbol= 5.15×L3000, 6.\\nFarina et al. (2022) argued that bolometric luminosities estimated using equation 6 are on\\naverage in between the ones calculated using the bolometric corrections from Runnoe et al.\\n(2012) and Trakhtenbrot & Netzer (2012). In the high-redshift quasar database presented\\ninSupplementary Material we reportL3000 so the readers can apply their preferred\\nbolometric correction.\\n18 Fan et al.\\n4.2. Current Demographics\\nAt redshifts 6 .0≲z≲7.6, the Mg iiline falls in the NIR K band. The vast majority\\nof the Mg ii-based BH masses come from NIR spectra taken with powerful ground-based\\ntelescopes such as Gemini, VLT, Magellan, and Keck (Shen et al. 2019, Onoue et al. 2019,\\nYang et al. 2021, Farina et al. 2022). At the time of writing, there are 113 quasars at\\nz >5.9 with reliable Mg ii-based black hole mass estimates. Currently, there is a strong\\nbias towards luminous ( ≳1046erg s−1) quasars, but obtaining reliable measurements for\\nfainter sources is challenging with current facilities (see Onoue et al. 2019). We will need\\nJWST and ELTs to enlarge the sample towards the faint end signiﬁcantly. Fig. 6 shows the\\nbolometric luminosity and BH mass distribution for all quasars with Mg ii-based masses at\\nz >5.9. The median BH mass is 1 .3×109M⊙, while the least and most massive quasars\\nare J0859+0022 at z= 6.39 (∼4×107M⊙; Onoue et al. 2019) and J0100+2802 at z= 6.33\\n(∼1010M⊙; Wu et al. 2015), respectively.\\nThe ﬁrst samples of NIR spectroscopic observations of ≳6 quasars showed that they\\naccrete close to the Eddington limit, i.e., λEdd≈1 (e.g., Willott et al. 2003, Kurk et al. 2007,\\nDe Rosa et al. 2011). Extending the measurements to larger samples (Shen et al. 2019) or\\nprobing to fainter luminosities (Onoue et al. 2019) revealed a signiﬁcant number of quasars\\naccreting at sub-Eddington rates. The recent works by Yang et al. (2021) and Farina et al.\\n(2022) analyzed some of the largest samples of NIR spectra of z≳6 quasars. Yang et al.\\n(2021) studied 37 quasars at z>6.3 and found that these quasars have signiﬁcantly higher\\nEddington ratios (mean of 1.08 and median 0.85) than a luminosity-matched quasar sample\\nat low redshift. Farina et al. (2022) studied the NIR spectra of 135 z≳5.7 quasars (including\\nBH properties derived from Mg iiand C iv), ﬁnding that at z∼6 the Eddington ratio\\ndistributions are consistent with a luminosity-matched low-redshift sample independent of\\nthe luminosity, while there is evidence for a mild increase in the median Eddington ratios\\nforz≳6.5 (in agreement with Yang et al. 2021).\\nIn our current compilation (Fig. 6), the Eddington ratio ranges from 0 .08 to 2.70, with a\\nmedian of 0.79 and a mean of 0.92. Forty quasars exceed the nominal Eddington limit, and\\neight haveλEdd>2. These values must be considered with caution as there is a substantial\\nscatter in the BH mass estimations (see Section 4.1).\\n4.3. Constraints on Early BH Seeds and Growth\\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the SMBHs powering the ﬁrst quasars have quickly grown to enormous\\nsizes, and explaining this mass growth remains challenging. Assuming a 100% duty cycle,\\nthe mass of the SMBH would grow exponentially as:\\nMBH(t) =MBH,seed×exp[\\n(1−ϵr)λEddt\\ntSal]\\n7.\\nwhereϵris the radiative eﬃciency, which is the eﬃciency of converting mass to energy and\\nthe Salpeter time is deﬁned as:\\ntSal=ϵrσTc\\n4πGm p≈ϵr450 Myr. 8.\\nAssumingλEdd= 1 andϵr= 0.1, Equation 7 equals to\\nMBH(t) =MBH,seed×exp[t\\n50 Myr]\\n9.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 19\\n7 8 9 10\\nlogMBH(M⊙)4445464748logLBol(erg s−1)z>5.9\\nquasars\\nFigure 6\\nBolometric luminosity vs. BH mass.

Solid gray\\nlines show the location of constant accretion rate at 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 5 times the Eddington\\nluminosity. All BH masses are from Mg iimeasurements using equation 4 and the bolometric\\nluminosities are derived using Equation 6.\\nWe used these assumptions for the growth tracks in Fig. 7. We note that either a higher\\nϵror a<100% duty cycle would make the constraints on BH growth even tighter. Fig. 7\\nshowcases how pushing the redshift frontier makes the formation and growth of SMBHs ever\\nmore challenging. Several potential theories have been developed to explain the existence\\nof∼109M⊙BHs atz < 6. However, for the current redshift records at z∼7.5, at\\nleast under standard assumptions (i.e., Eddington-limited growth with ϵr= 0.1) only the\\nheaviest “seeds” seem to be big enough to form these sources in such a short time, although\\nthey need to have sustained accretion their entire lifetime. For a thorough overview of the\\ntheoretical BH “seeds” we refer to the review by Inayoshi et al. (2020). Other alternatives\\nnot represented in Fig. 7 involve radiative ineﬃcient/highly obscured growth ( ϵr≪0.1;\\nDavies et al. 2019) or jet-enhanced accretion growth (Jolley & Kuncic 2008). According to\\nPacucci & Loeb (2022), the discovery of one ∼1010M⊙black hole at z≳9 would exclude\\nthe entire parameter space available for ∼100M⊙seeds.\\nHowever, it is important to note that these stringent constraints mainly apply to the\\nmost massive BHs at the highest redshift.

The (Near) Future for Black Hole Mass Measurements at High Redshift\\n4.4.1. H β-derived masses. With JWST, robust H β-based mass estimates of the most dis-\\ntant quasars ﬁnally has become feasible (see Section 4.1). The JWST instruments NIRSpec\\nand NIRCam can obtain spectroscopic observations of the H βline in quasars at 5 ≲z≲10.\\nHβBH masses are expected to be one of the ﬁrst results from the ﬁrst observations of\\nhigh-redshift quasars with JWST.\\n4.4.2. Direct dynamical mass measurements. The unprecedented resolution provided by\\nALMA can spatially resolve the sphere of inﬂuence of central black holes in nearby galaxies,\\nenabling direct gas-dynamical BH mass measurements (e.g., Cohn et al. 2021).

Recent ALMA observations of the [C ii]emission\\nline inz>6 quasar hosts are approaching resolutions comparable to the expected sphere of\\ninﬂuence of SMBHs (e.g., Walter et al. 2022). We anticipate that in the upcoming years,\\nsuch measurement will be possible, at least for some selected objects, and this will be an\\nactive area of research with the ngVLA (Carilli & Shao 2018).\\n5. A MULTI WAVELENGTH VIEW OF QUASAR/GALAXY CO-EVOLUTION\\nAT THE HIGHEST REDSHIFTS\\nIn the local Universe there are tight correlations between the mass of the central SMBHs\\nand the stellar bulge of the galaxy (see review by Kormendy & Ho 2013). When and how\\nthese tight correlations arose is an open question. Constraints at the highest redshifts can\\nprovide essential clues when the time to grow a galaxy and BH is limited. Did the BH grow\\nﬁrst, and the galaxy follow? Vice versa? Or did they grow together? What are the main\\nfeedback mechanisms? How are the massive galaxies hosting quasars connected to their\\nlarge-scale environment?\\nIn this section, we will ﬁrst review the current eﬀorts to detect the gas reservoirs required\\nfor the growth of the central SMBH and the formation of stars (Section 5.1). We will then\\ngive an overview of the eﬀorts to measure the stellar UV light from the z>6 quasar hosts\\nand the recent successes in constraining their cold dust and gas via (sub)mm observations\\n(Section 5.2). We will then discuss how we can use this information to constrain BH/galaxy\\nco-evolution (Section 4.3) and describe observational evidence (or lack of) quasar feedback\\n(Section 5.4). Finally, we will give an overview of the eﬀorts for using z≳6 quasars as\\nsignposts for overdensities and large-scale structure in the early Universe (Section 5.5).\\n5.1. Quasar fueling - Ly αnebuale\\nEnormous gas reservoirs are required to grow the SMBHs seen in the highest-redshift quasars\\ncontinuously. Extended Ly αnebulae (also referred to as Ly αhalos) trace the cold gas\\nreservoirs likely feeding the central SMBH. In principle, such gas reservoirs are likely also\\nstar-forming regions (Haiman & Rees 2001, Di Matteo et al. 2017). The ﬁrst eﬀorts to look\\nfor these nebulae used narrow-band ﬁlters centered on the expected Ly αemission (e.g., Goto\\net al. 2009, Decarli et al. 2012, Momose et al. 2019) and through deep long-slit spectroscopy\\n(e.g., Willott et al. 2011, Roche et al. 2014). The implications of these detections (as well\\nas non-detections) were often diﬃcult to interpret due to slit and narrow-band ﬂux losses.\\nSometimes the same quasar observed with narrow-band imaging and long-slit spectroscopy\\nyielded conﬂicting results.\\nThe search for these Ly αnebulae had a signiﬁcant step forward with the new Inte-\\ngral Field Spectrographs (IFS) mounted on 8-m class telescopes, particularly VLT/MUSE.\\nIFS enabled 3D morphology/kinematics of the Ly αhalos (Drake et al. 2019). The most\\ncomprehensive search for Ly αhalos to date is the REQUIEM survey (Farina et al. 2019),\\ntargeting 31 z >5.7 quasars with VLT/MUSE. REQUIEM revealed 12 Ly αnebulae with\\na range of luminosities and morphologies extending up to 30 kpc. Recently, Drake et al.\\n22 Fan et al.\\n(2022) reported that the Ly αmorphology and kinematics seem decoupled from the gas in\\nthe host galaxies as traced by [C ii]emission. This result might imply that the observed\\nLyαhalos are being powered by the central SMBH instead of tracing star formation, in\\nline with recent simulations (Costa et al. 2022). Nevertheless, the resonant nature of the\\nLyαline makes it diﬃcult to disentangle the AGN/star-formation contribution completely.\\nIFS observations of additional non-resonant lines (e.g., H αwith JWST) will be needed to\\nconﬁrm these results.\\n5.2. Quasar Host Galaxy Observations - Sites of Massive Galaxy Evolution\\nGiven the extreme luminosities and inferred BH masses of these quasars, we would expect\\nthat they reside in hosts with signiﬁcant stellar mass already in place (Kormendy & Ho\\n2013). However, the brightness of their central accreting BHs has prevented direct detection\\nof the underlying starlight at (observed) optical and near-infrared wavelengths even with\\nHST (e.g., Mechtley et al. 2012, Marshall et al. 2020). JWST’s unprecedented resolution,\\nsensitivity, and wavelength coverage should overcome most of the shortcomings of previous\\nattempts, as Marshall et al. (2021) have demonstrated with simulations. Several cycle 1\\nJWST programs attempt to reveal the stellar light of z≳6 quasar hosts for the ﬁrst time.\\n1 2 3\\nlogSFRIR(Myr1)\\n0.51.01.52.02.53.03.5logSFR[CII](Myr1)\\n0510Number11 12 13log(LIR/L)\\n0 10\\nNumber8.08.59.09.510.0\\nlog(L[CII]/L)\\nRadio-loud\\nRadio-quiet\\n1-to-1 relation\\nDetected\\nUndetected\\nFigure 8\\nStar-formation distributions for radio-quiet (small points) and radio-loud (circles) quasars at\\nz≳6, derived from [C ii]and IR luminosities (Figure adapted from Khusanova et al. 2022).\\nThe radiation at observed far-IR (FIR) to mm wavelengths of z≳6 quasars is dominated\\nby the reprocessed emission from cool/warm dust in the host galaxy. These wavelengths\\nprovide the best window to study host galaxy properties, minimizing contamination from\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 23\\nthe quasar’s accretion disk emission. Pioneering works pushed the limits of mm and radio\\nfacilities to characterize the dust and the molecular and atomic gas in the ﬁrst bright\\nz≳6 quasars discovered (e.g., Bertoldi et al. 2003, Walter et al. 2003, Maiolino et al.\\n2005, Beelen et al. 2006, Wang et al. 2007, 2008). These studies were only sensitive to the\\nmost luminous systems, and found that about 1/3 of high redshift quasar host galaxies have\\nluminosity comparable to those of hyper-luminous IR galaxies ( LFIR∼1013L⊙). Assuming\\nthe dust heating came from starburst activity, this suggested enormous star formation rates\\nof 100−1000M⊙yr−1. Therefore, these early studies showed that early SMBH growth\\ncan be accompanied by extended, intense star formation and large reservoirs of dense and\\nenriched molecular gas.\\nRapid progress has been made in FIR observations of high-redshift quasar host galaxies\\nwith the advent of ALMA and major upgrades on the NOEMA interferometers (conveniently\\nlocated in diﬀerent hemispheres). The greatest advances can be divided into three major\\nareas: (i)sensitivity, (ii)resolution, (iii) multi-line tracers of the ISM.\\nSensitivity: The [C ii]158µmﬁne-structure line, which is the primary coolant of the cold\\nneutral atomic medium, has become the workhorse for studies of z≳6 quasar hosts. This\\nwas the natural choice as [C ii]is one of the brightest emission lines in star-forming galaxies\\nand its frequency at z > 6 is conveniently located in a high-transmission atmospheric\\nwindow visible with ALMA and NOEMA. [C ii]detections using the early generation of\\ninterferometers were challenging. By the time of the review of Carilli & Walter (2013),\\nthere were only two z≳6 quasars with [C ii]detections, while now that number is ∼80.\\n[Cii]line and IR continuum luminosities measurements provide independent estimates of\\nSFR. Fig 8 shows a recent compilation of the [C ii]and IR luminosities and SFRs for z≳6\\nquasar hosts.\\nEarly ALMA results demonstrated its ability to study [C ii]emission from quasar hosts\\nof both UV-bright and UV-faint z≳6 quasars (Wang et al. 2013, Willott et al. 2013).\\nThese studies motivated the push to larger samples, marking the transition from studies\\nof individual interesting sources to the ﬁrst statistical samples. Decarli et al. (2018) and\\nVenemans et al. (2018) presented results from an ALMA snapshot survey of a large sample\\nof luminous z∼6 quasars to study their FIR continuum and [C ii]properties. Remarkably,\\neven with integration time of ≲15 min on ALMA, the detection rate is ≳90% for these\\nquasars. They found typical [C ii]luminosities of 109−1010L⊙, FIR luminosities of 0 .3−\\n13×1012L⊙, and estimated dust masses of 107−109M⊙with star formation rates ranging\\nfrom 50 to 2700 M⊙yr−1. ALMA also enabled detections of FIR continuum and [C ii]\\nemission in a signiﬁcant number of UV-faint quasars at high redshift (e.g., Izumi et al.\\n2018, 2019). Overall, there are only weak correlations between the bolometric luminosity\\nof quasars (dominated by emission from accretion disk in the rest-frame UV/optical) and\\nthe FIR luminosity of the quasar hosts (dominated by star formation).\\nResolution: The unprecedented spatial resolution of ALMA allowed imaging of the ISM\\nofz >6 quasar host galaxies at sub-kpc resolution for the ﬁrst time. The ﬁrst studies at\\nkpc scales (∼0.2−0.3′′) revealed interesting morphological characteristics. For example,\\nShao et al. (2017) found ordered motion in a z= 6.13 host that can be modeled with a\\nrotating disk, Venemans et al. (2017a) report a remarkably compact ( ≲1 kpc) host galaxy\\natz= 7.08 that does not exhibit ordered motion on kpc scales, and Ba˜ nados et al. (2019a)\\nshowed that a galaxy merger hosts a z= 7.54 quasar.\\nVenemans et al. (2020) presented a survey of 27 host galaxies at z∼6 imaged at kpc\\nscale with ALMA. They showed that the [C ii]emission in the bright, central regions of the\\n24 Fan et al.\\nFigure 9\\nALMA [C ii]observations of quasar hosts reveal diverse morphologies and kinematics (ﬁgure\\nadapted from Neeleman et al. 2021).

The implied star formation rate densities at the center of these quasar hosts are a\\nfew hundred M⊙yr−1kpc−2, below the Eddington limit for star formation (although there\\nare examples of host galaxies forming stars at near the maximum possible rate, e.g., Andika\\net al. 2020, Yue et al. 2021b). Neeleman et al. (2021) modeled the kinematics of these 27\\nhost galaxies. They found a large diversity in the quasar host properties. About 1/3 of\\nthe galaxies show smooth velocity gradients consistent with emission from a gaseous disk.\\nAbout 1/3 have no evident velocity gradients, with their kinematics dominated by random\\nmotion. The ﬁnal 1/3 exhibit signatures of close companion interaction or galaxy merger\\nactivities (see Fig. 9 for examples). The highest resolution observations that currently exist\\nforz>6 quasars are 400 pc for a quasar host at z= 6.6 (Venemans et al. 2019) and 200 pc\\nfor a host galaxy at z= 6.9 (Walter et al. 2022). These two studies highlight the power\\nof ALMA by revealing complex morphologies, [C ii]cavities in the gas distribution, and in\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 25\\none case very compact dust continuum and [C ii]emission, reaching extreme densities in\\nthe central 200 pc from the SMBH. We expect that observations at comparable resolution\\nor higher will be an active area of investigation in the near future.\\nA key result of these morphological studies is that the population of host galaxies of\\nluminous early quasars is diverse. While, on average, they are sites of massive galaxy\\nassembly, they also appear to be in diﬀerent evolutionary phases. Apparently, the peak of\\nquasar activity is not tied to a particular stage of early galaxy formation in those systems.\\nFigure 10\\nBlack hole mass vs. host dynamical mass for z≳6 quasars (ﬁgure from Neeleman et al. 2021).\\nThe gray points are local galaxies and the shaded region is the best-ﬁt local relation (Kormendy &\\nHo 2013). The z≳6 sample is divided by their [C ii]morphology (see legend) and it is generally\\nabove the local relation.\\nMulti-line diagnostics: Even though the [C ii]emission line is important for redshift\\ndetermination and gas dynamics (as discussed above), it cannot constrain the physics of\\nthe ISM by itself. A suite of emission lines tracing various phases of the ISM is required to\\ncharacterize the physical conditions such as temperature, ionization, density, and metallic-\\nity. At the time of writing, this is an area of rapid development, and about a dozen quasar\\nhosts have been detected in more than one tracer. Some of the main targeted lines (in\\naddition to [C ii]) are:\\n•The neutral carbon emission [CI] 369 µmline, which traces the atomic medium in the\\nexternal shells of molecular clouds (e.g., Yang et al. 2019a, Pensabene et al. 2021).\\n•Two transitions of the [NII] line (205 µm and 122µm), which is a pure tracer of the\\nionized medium and can be used to measure the fraction of [C ii]associated with the\\nneutral medium (e.g., Novak et al. 2019, Li et al. 2020).\\n•The [OI] 146 µm line , which is sensitive to the temperature of the atomic gas in the\\ngalaxy (e.g., Li et al. 2020, Meyer et al. 2022b).\\n•The [OIII] 88 µm line , which provides critical diagnostics for the conditions of star\\nformation and the properties of massive stars (e.g., Walter et al. 2018, Hashimoto\\net al. 2019, Novak et al. 2019).\\n26 Fan et al.\\n•Several rotational CO transitions : considered as the main probe of the molecular\\ngas in dense star-forming regions (e.g., Gallerani et al. 2014, Venemans et al. 2017b,\\nNovak et al. 2019, Decarli et al. 2022, Li et al. 2022b, Pensabene et al. 2021, Yang\\net al. 2019a)\\n•Several water lines that arise in the warm, dense phase of the interstellar medium and\\na number of OH molecular lines that are usually associated with outﬂows of dense\\nmaterial (e.g., Yang et al. 2019a, Pensabene et al. 2021, 2022).\\nA combination of these diﬀerent tracers yields molecular gas masses in the range MH2∼\\n1010−1011M⊙, and ISM metallicities comparable to the solar value. Generally, the observed\\nluminosities are better modeled by photo-dissociation regions instead of X-ray-dominated\\nregions (see the review by Wolﬁre et al. 2022). The current small sample of quasars with\\nmultiple ISM tracers is highly biased towards objects bright in [C ii]. We expect that the\\ncharacterization of physical conditions of the ISM in early massive galaxies will be expanded\\nto much larger samples.\\n5.3. Constraints on Galaxy Mass and Black Hole/Galaxy Co-Evolution\\nDynamical masses of the quasar hosts can be measured using spatially and kinematically\\nresolved line observations (see Section 5.2). The dynamical mass enclosed within a radius\\nRis typically expressed as:\\nMdyn=v2\\ncirc\\nGR, 11.\\nwhereGis the gravitational constant and vcircis the maximum circular velocity of the\\ngas disk. Obtaining vcircis not trivial, as it requires knowing the inclination angle of the\\ngalaxy. Estimates of dynamical masses combined with robust BH masses (Section 4.1) make\\nit feasible to push BH/galaxy co-evolution studies to the highest accessible redshifts.\\nWang et al. (2010) measured dynamical masses using CO emission from 8 quasar hosts\\natz∼6. Assuming an average inclination angle of 40◦andR= 2.5 kpc, they found that the\\nz∼6 quasars have, on average, SMBHs a factor 15 more massive than expected from the\\nlocal BH – bulge mass relation. This result suggests that BHs in high redshift quasars either\\ngot a major head-start or grew faster than their host galaxies; if the M- σrelation existed\\natz∼6, would show a strong cosmic evolution. Numerous subsequent works have focused\\non the correlation of SMBH mass and galaxy dynamical mass at these redshifts (e.g., Wang\\net al. 2016, Decarli et al. 2018). Most of these studies had to assume an inclination angle\\nand/or an average size for the emitting gas. Neeleman et al. (2021) carried out careful\\ndynamic modeling of their [C ii]observations (including inclination and size). They found\\na mean dynamical mass of ∼5×1010M⊙for a sample of luminous z∼6 quasars with\\n∼109M⊙BHs. As shown in Fig. 10, this places them about one order of magnitude above\\nthe local relation. It is important to note that the relationship could be strongly aﬀected\\nby potential biases from selection and by using gas tracers (Huang et al. 2018, Volonteri\\n& Stark 2011). Indeed, observations of low luminosity quasars show a narrower [C ii]line\\nwidth (e.g., Willott et al. 2017, Izumi et al. 2018), placing them close to the local relation.\\nHabouzit et al. (2022) analyzed the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies in six\\ncosmological simulations with diﬀerent models for SMBH growth. Although the simulations\\nare all consistent at z∼0, they diverge at z>5, highlighting the importance of obtaining\\nrobust observational constraints at these redshifts. Li et al. (2022a) argued that to robustly\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 27\\nconﬁrm whether the highest-redshift quasar population resides above the local BH - bulge\\nmass relation, an improvement in the accuracy of mass measurements and an expansion\\nof the current sample to lower black hole masses is required. We expect that JWST will\\nenable signiﬁcant advances for BH and galaxy host masses.\\n5.4. Evidence of Quasar Feedback\\nCentral accreting SMBHs play an important role in shaping galaxy evolution (see review\\nby Fabian 2012). Indeed, to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxy masses at z= 0,\\nsimulations require that strong AGN feedback was already in place at z∼6 (e.g., Kaviraj\\net al. 2017). Below we list some of the observational evidence (with caveats) that these\\nfeedback mechanisms are taking place in the z≳6 quasar population:\\nUV Line Shifts. High-redshift quasars show asymmetric shape and velocity oﬀset of\\nhigh ionization lines, in particular the C ivline. The low-redshift quasar population shows\\nan overall blueshifted C ivline (∼800 km s−1) compared to the systemic redshift of the\\nquasar (e.g., traced by H β, Shen et al. 2011). This shift is generally understood in the\\ncontext of a strong accretion disk wind that contributes to the high-ionization lines (e.g.,\\nRichards et al. 2011). At z >6, the C ivline velocity shift is much stronger ( ∼1800 km\\ns−1, Schindler et al. 2020). Meyer et al. (2019) suggested that this redshift evolution can be\\nexplained by the C ivwinds being launched from the disk with an increased torus opacity\\nat this redshift.\\nBAL Quasars. A fraction of quasars show broad and highly blue-shifted absorption\\nfeatures in their rest-frame UV transitions. BAL features trace ionized winds in the broad\\nline region and are recognized signatures of SMBH feedback. Bischetti et al. (2022) used\\nhigh-quality spectra of quasars from the XQR30 survey to show that up to ∼50% of\\nluminous quasars at z∼6 exhibit BAL features (with outﬂow velocities up to 17% of\\nthe speed of light), compared to about 20% observed in low-redshift samples. Yang et al.\\n(2021) studied 37 quasars at 6 .3<z< 7.64 and reported a BAL fraction of ∼24%, smaller\\nthan the Bischetti et al. (2022) work but still slightly larger than what is observed at lower\\nredshifts. This potential evolution of the BAL fraction could be a result of the strong\\nfeedback associated with the rapid BH growth and galaxy assembly in the early Universe.\\nLyαhalos. The existence of extended Ly αnebulae around z≳6 quasars was discussed\\nin Section 5.1. Recently, Costa et al. (2022) performed a suite of cosmological, radiation-\\nhydrodynamic simulations to understand the origin and properties of the observed Ly α\\nhalos. The simulations unambiguously require quasar-powered outﬂows to match the ob-\\nserved properties at z≳6, providing indirect evidence for AGN feedback.\\nRadio jets . Only six galaxies hosting radio-loud quasars at z≳6 have been studied with\\nALMA and NOEMA (Rojas-Ruiz et al. 2021, Khusanova et al. 2022). Assuming no AGN\\ncontribution, their, their [C ii]- and FIR-derived star-formation properties are consistent\\nwith those reported for the much more studied radio-quiet quasars (c.f., Decarli et al. 2018,\\nVenemans et al. 2020; see Fig. 8). However, Rojas-Ruiz et al. (2021) and Khusanova et al.\\n(2022) show indirect evidence that the FIR emission of radio-loud quasars can be strongly\\naﬀected by synchrotron emission. In that case, their IR-derived star formation rates can\\nbe overestimated, implying that we might be witnessing negative AGN feedback at z >6.\\nHowever, more measurements of the FIR continuum and/or an enlarged sample are required\\nto quantify the potential impact on the population.\\n28 Fan et al.\\nBroad components of [CII] emission. Broad wings ( ≳1000 km s−1) in the [C ii]emission\\nlines are thought to be caused by AGN outﬂows. The observational evidence for these [C ii]\\nbroad wings remain tentative, as diﬀerent analyses of similar datasets provide inconsistent\\nresults. For example, Maiolino et al. (2012) and Cicone et al. (2015) reported a strong [C ii]\\noutﬂow in the host galaxy of the quasar J1148+5251 at z= 6.42. Meyer et al. (2022b),\\non the other hand, found no evidence of a broad velocity component but reported that\\nJ1148+5251 has the most spatially extended [C ii]emission (∼10 kpc) among z∼6 quasar\\nhosts. Izumi et al. (2021) report a broad ( ∼1000 km s−1) [Cii]wing in the spectrum of a\\nquasar atz= 7.07, and Khusanova et al. (2022) reported a tentative [C ii]broad component\\nthat could be as wide as ∼1400 km s−1in a BAL radio-loud quasar at z= 6.12. Bischetti\\net al. (2019) stacked the [C ii]spectra of 48 quasars at 4 .5<z< 7.1 and reported a broad\\n[Cii]component, while Decarli et al. (2018) stacked the [C ii]spectra of 23 z∼6 quasar\\nhosts and found no evidence for a [C ii]broad component. Novak et al. (2020) stacked\\nthe [C ii]spectra using diﬀerent techniques (spectral stacking and uv-plane stacking) and\\nfound no evidence for [C ii]broad-line emission. Novak et al. (2020) argued that the results\\ncan depend on the stacking techniques and resolution (e.g., if the resolution is low nearby\\ncompanions can be confused with [C ii]wings).\\nOH absorption. The hydroxyl molecule (OH) in absorption traces high-velocity molec-\\nular inﬂow or outﬂows (see review by Veilleux et al. 2020). Herrera-Camus et al. (2020)\\nreport the ﬁrst tentative detection (3 σ) of the OH 119 µm doublet in absorption towards a\\nz≳6 quasar, suggesting the presence of a molecular outﬂow. Outﬂow signatures from both\\natomic and molecular lines will be a focus of future high-quality ALMA observations.\\nJ0836+0054 at z=5.8J1030+0524 at z=6.3\\nFigure 11\\nThe twoz≳6 quasars with robust overdensities on ≳1 Mpc scales.

Protoclusters and Large Scale Structure\\nTheoretical models predict that z≳6 quasars should be highly biased tracers of the under-\\nlying dark matter distribution, signposting the ﬁrst overdensities of galaxies on Mpc scales,\\ni.e., protoclusters (e.g., Overzier et al. 2009, Costa et al. 2014; but some scatter is expected,\\nsee e.g., Ren et al. 2021). Observationally, this has been challenging to demonstrate. Photo-\\nmetric selection around high-redshift quasars has found evidence for overdensities (e.g., Ut-\\nsumi et al. 2010, Morselli et al. 2014), densities comparable to random ﬁelds (e.g., Ba˜ nados\\net al. 2013, Simpson et al. 2014, Mazzucchelli et al. 2017a), and even underdensities (e.g.,\\nKim et al. 2009).\\nThere are currently two z≳6 quasar ﬁelds with robust overdensities (i.e., including\\nspectroscopic conﬁrmation) on Mpc scales (Overzier 2022, Mignoli et al. 2020; see Fig. 11).\\nThese are SDSS J1030+0524 at z= 6.3 and SDSS J0836+0054 at z= 5.8. The works by\\nStiavelli et al. (2005), Kim et al. (2009), Simpson et al. (2014), Balmaverde et al. (2017),\\nDecarli et al. (2019b) were crucial for conﬁrming the overdense environment of J1030+0524.\\nSimilarly, Zheng et al. (2006), Ajiki et al. (2006), Bosman et al. (2020) were fundamental\\nfor conﬁrming the large-scale structure around J0836+0054. Recently, Yue et al. (2021a)\\nreport the ﬁrst quasar pair known at z∼6 (with a projected separation <10 kpc), implying\\na rich environment that still awaits conﬁrmation at larger scales.\\nALMA observations of z∼6 quasars hosts (see Section 5.2) have serendipitously de-\\ntected a population of [C ii]-bright companion galaxies in the immediate environment of\\n∼20-50% of the targeted quasars (Decarli et al. 2017, Neeleman et al. 2019, Venemans et al.\\n2020; see also bottom panel of Fig. 9). The large fraction of such quasar-galaxy pairs exceeds\\nby orders of magnitude the expectations based on the current constraints of the number\\ndensity of [C ii]-bright galaxies at these redshifts. Three out of ﬁve quasar companions with\\ndeep HST observations remain undetected (Mazzucchelli et al. 2019, Decarli et al. 2019a),\\nimplying a signiﬁcant part of a potential large-scale structure might be obscured. The two\\nHST-detected companions show tentative evidence of AGN activity (Connor et al. 2019,\\nVito et al. 2019b; but see also Vito et al. 2021).\\nThe ﬁeld of view of ALMA is too small to study whether these gas-rich companions exist\\nin large numbers over Mpc scales as predicted by simulations. MUSE observations of one of\\nthese quasar/companion ﬁelds reveal two additional LAEs in close proximity, strengthening\\nthe case for an overdensity (Meyer et al. 2022a). It is likely that the next leap on our\\nunderstanding of the environment of the highest-redshift quasars will come with JWST.\\nJWST deep imaging, multi-object, and slitless spectroscopy capabilities will provide a new\\nopportunity to probe the galaxy population in z≳6 quasar environments to unprecedented\\ndepth over the Mpc scales.\\n6. QUASARS AS PROBES OF COSMIC REIONIZATION\\nQuasars are both agents, and powerful probes of the cosmic reionization history. As rare but\\nluminous sources with hard ionizing spectra, they contribute to the overall photon budget\\ndriving reionization, together with stellar photons from galaxies. Absorption measured\\nin quasar spectra from foreground gas has yielded many of the most sensitive constraints\\non the density, ionization, and chemical enrichment of this tenuous intergalactic material.\\nWhile quasars’ utility as reionization probes has been understood since foundational work\\nby Gunn & Peterson (1965), it has taken 40-50 years for quasar surveys to uncover objects\\ndeep into the reionization epoch and fully exploit the information that their absorption\\n30 Fan et al.\\nspectra encode (Fan et al. 2006b).\\nWhile absorption studies have yielded many of the most precise constraints on the IGM\\nopacity and neutral hydrogen fraction, they are subject to limitations on both system-\\natic accuracy, and physical interpretation. These limitations arise from multiple sources,\\nbut the most signiﬁcant factors discussed below are (a) uncertainty in the quasar’s in-\\ntrinsic/unabsorbed spectral continuum, (b) the large on-resonance oscillator strength of\\nHiLyα, which leads to a wide gap in sensitivity between neutral fractions of XHi∼10−4\\n(where resonance absorption saturates) and ∼10−1(where damping wings appear), and\\n(c) computational challenges of simulating representative volumes with inhomogeneous and\\nrapidly evolving radiation ﬁelds.\\n6.1. AGN and the Ionizing Photon Budget\\nQuasar accretion produces a hard ionizing spectrum, making the AGN population a con-\\ntributing source to the budget of photons needed for reionization. However as detailed in\\nthe recent review by Robertson (2021) and references therein, there is an emerging con-\\nsensus that AGN play a subdominant role compared to galaxies as an overall driver of the\\nphase transition, even when one extrapolates observed luminosity functions to thresholds\\nfainter than current detection limits. Jiang et al. (2022) further reinforced this conclusion\\nby placing an upper limit on the contributions of low luminosity AGN to reionization us-\\ning deep HST survey data. Finkelstein & Bagley (2022) have synthesized measurements\\nacross the lierature of galaxy+AGN UV luminosity functions, to estimate their relative\\ncontributions to the ionizing photon budget, using strong assumptions about the ionizing\\nradiation escape fractions of each population. They estimate that AGN supply ∼10% of\\nthe total ionizing photon budget at z∼5, roughly the lower limit of redshifts considered in\\nour review. They found that this fraction drops rapidly toward higher redshift because of\\ndiﬀerential downward evolution in the quasar luminosity function relative to galaxies. By\\nz∼7 they estimate that AGN contribute only 0 .3−1.0% of all ionizing photons, declining\\nby yet another order of magnitude by z∼9. In contrast, Giallongo et al. (2019) suggested\\nthat AGN contributions to the UV background can still be signiﬁcant at z∼5.6 based on\\nX-ray selected objects.\\nThe quantitative uncertainties in these analyses are still considerable; Finkelstein et al.\\n(2019) found a 10 ×higher contribution from AGN at z∼7 using diﬀerent assumptions.\\nMuch of this may be attributed to uncertainties in the faint end slope of the quasar lu-\\nminosity function. Still, the qualitative picture that reionization is heavily dominated by\\nstar-forming galaxies appears to remain fairly robust with respect to these uncertainties.\\nThe fractional contribution of quasars and AGN increases toward lower redshift because of\\ntheir rapidly rising number densities, such that they are more likely to dominate the meta-\\ngalactic UV background in the at z <4 post-reionization universe. New surveys with the\\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and JWST should revolutionize this ﬁeld, providing\\nboth deep, near-IR color selected objects deep into the EoR, and also sensitive spectra to\\nconﬁrm the AGN nature of faint candidates and separate them from star-forming galaxies.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 31\\n0.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Flux     \\n     ï15ï10ï50R (Physical Mpc)ï10ï50xHI\\nIonization FrontDampingWingz ≳ 70.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Flux     \\n     ï15ï10ï50R (Physical Mpc)ï10ï50xHIProximity Zonez ∼ 6\\nBehind QSOFigure 12\\nObservable properties and interpretation of Proximity Zones (upper left) and Damping Wings\\n(upper right).

There is no\\nabsorption redward of the quasar’s Ly αemission line (marked with a gray shaded region), and a\\nregion of low optical depth extends Rp∼5−10 proper Mpc.

On-resonance absorption is\\nsaturated up to and very near the quasar’s emission redshift, and the oﬀ-resonance Damping\\nWing (shaded blue) extends redward of Ly αin the quasar’s rest frame. Constraints on the IGM\\nneutral fraction come from this blue shaded zone, as well as the very short run of unsaturated\\npixels between the QSO’s systemic redshift and the end of the proximity zone.\\n6.2. Neutral Hydrogen Absorption in the Diﬀuse IGM\\nThe optical depth from neutral Hydrogen in a matter-dominated universe (appropriate for\\nthe redshifts considered here) is:\\nτ(λobs) =πe2f12\\nmec(\\nc\\nH0Ω1/2\\nM∫z\\n0nHI(z)\\n(1 +z)5/2φ(c/[λ0(1 +z)])dz)\\n12.\\nThe leading fraction has units of cross section per unit frequency in terms of the dimension-\\nless oscillator strength f12, which is an atomic constant determined for each ion ( f12= 0.416\\nfor Lyα). The expression in brackets reﬂects a column density, i.e. an integral of the radial\\nline element, weighted by the H idensity ﬁeld. The function φ(ν) is a unity-normalized line\\nshape. It is typically approximated as a Voigt proﬁle, which consists of a deep Gaussian line\\ncore whose width is determined by internal velocities, convolved with a much wider but also\\nmuch weaker Lorentzian wing. This so-called “damping wing” arises from an energy-time\\nuncertainty in the Ly αtransition, leading to a small but non-zero absorption cross section\\nin the rest frame for photons far from the resonance wavelength λrest= 1215.67˚A. Equation\\n12 indicates that the optical depth at each observed wavelength λobscontains contributions\\n32 Fan et al.\\nfrom neutral hydrogen at every intervening foreground redshift.\\nHowever because φ(ν) is so sharply peaked around line resonance, the integral is almost\\nalways dominated by matter at the redshift where λobs/(1 +z) =λrest. Directly at this\\nresonance wavelength, the Ly αcross section is very large—roughly 4 ×10−14cm2. Moreover\\nthe mean baryonic density increases toward high redshift as\\n¯nH(z)∼Ωbρc\\nµmH(1 +z)3= 8.6×10−5(1 +z\\n7)3\\ncm−3, 13.\\nwhich increases both the total gas column density, and also the H irecombination rate,\\nfavoring a higher neutral gas fraction XHi. Collectively these lead to a very large Ly α\\noptical depth of τ∼105if the IGM is 100% neutral.\\nHowever, observations show τ=O(∼1) at 2<z < 4; the presence of transmitted ﬂux\\nimplies that the Ly αforest is only neutral at the XHi∼10−5level. The optical depth\\nincreases toward high redshift in tandem with the neutral fraction, but by the time the\\nneutral fraction reaches XHi∼10−4, the optical depth already exceeds τ > 5, at which\\npoint>99% of the background quasar’s light is absorbed. On-resonance line absorption\\nis simply too strong to provide useful measurements of the neutral fraction XHiabove this\\nvalue.\\nIn contrast, the atomic cross section for a photon with wavelength in the Lorentzian\\ndamping wing is suppressed by 5–6 orders of magnitude relative to the peak at line center—\\neven at small velocity oﬀsets (100–200 km s−1). The eponymous Damped Lyman Alpha\\n(DLA) phenomenon is therefore only seen in small, rare high-overdensity environments\\nwith large column densities ( NHI>1020) atz<5.\\nReionization is characterized by an increasing neutral fraction in the diﬀuse IGM, which\\neventually becomes strong enough to produce damping wings (Miralda-Escud´ e 1998). How-\\never these are convolved with on-resonance absorption from H iat other redshifts, with the\\nunique exception of the quasar’s immediate foreground, where the damping wing can extend\\nredward of the Ly αemission line.\\nBridging this gap between strong on-resonance absorption, whose measurements probe\\n10−6< X Hi<10−4, and weak oﬀ-resonance damping wings which only emerge at\\nXHi>10−1is a recurring theme for IGM measurements near the reionization epoch. On-\\nresonance measurements are most useful in regions of locally enhanced ionization or at lower\\nredshifts (z<6.3) toward the late stages of reionization. Damping wing measurements are\\nmost powerful at early times and higher neutral fractions seen for z > 7. Observational\\nconstraints are much less precise for the epochs in the range 6 .3<z< 6.8, when the neutral\\nfraction evolved from 0 .01% to 10%— the Ly αline absorption is saturated, but damping\\nwings have not yet emerged.\\n6.2.1. Numerical Simulations. Cosmological simulations play an essential role in interpret-\\ning the spectra of reionization-epoch quasars, and placing their associated transmission\\nmeasurements into a broader physical context. We refer the reader to an excellent recent\\nreview (Gnedin & Madau 2022) on theoretical and numerical reionization models for a\\ncomprehensive overview of key methods and simulation projects.\\nBrieﬂy, simulations must confront several intersecting challenges in the attempt to repro-\\nduce the quasar spectral observables summarized below, together with luminosity functions\\nof reionization-era galaxy populations. An idealized simulation should have:\\n•A large box ( L>100 cMpc) to cover many scale lengths of the galaxy-galaxy auto-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 33\\ncorrelation function, and to sample the rare high-density peaks that could plausibly\\nhostM > 109M⊙SMBHs.\\n•Suﬃcient spatial and mass resolution to model disk galaxies realistically and resolve\\nlow-mass halos that produce light and heavy elements, as well as small-scale features\\nin the Lyαforest and Lyman Limit systems that act as ionizing radiation sinks.\\n•Ray tracing of emergent radiation from individual galaxies, to account for spatial\\nvariations in the density and ionizing background, shadowing from optically thick\\nabsorbers, or the timing of reionization.\\n•Full and self-consistent coupling of radiation to hydrodynamics, to capture the eﬀect\\nof ionization heating, pressure smoothing and adiabatic cooling on the evolving den-\\nsity ﬁeld and ionization fraction. These will also impact the formation of subsequent\\nstars and galaxies.\\nComputational limits prevent practical simulations from meeting all four these requirements\\nsimultaneously, though rapid progress in recent years has allowed some groups to progress\\nfrom analytic or semi-numerical eﬀorts to meet two or even three of the above bullets in\\nsingle simulations. The Gnedin & Madau review contains a helpful classiﬁcation of leading\\nnumerical projects according to their box sizes, hydro prescriptions, treatment of the UV\\nbackground, and radiation-hydro coupling.\\nWhile most large-scale simulations focus on reproducing global reionization signals such\\nas the volume-averaged neutral fraction, a separate numerical toolkit has evolved speciﬁcally\\nto interpret observations of proximity zones (Sec 6.3.1) and damping wings (Sec 6.3.2)\\nproduced in the immediate foreground of luminous quasars.\\nThese investigations begin with global simulations of the reionization-era IGM, and in-\\ntroduce the eﬀect of a high-luminosity quasar by hand in the simulation volume. A large\\nparent simulation is searched for high-mass halos ( M≥1−2×1011M⊙) representative of\\nhosts where SMBHs are ﬁrst thought to form. A bright quasar is then inserted at the center\\nof the halo, emitting ionizing photons with a luminosity scaled to the absolute 1450 ˚A mag-\\nnitude of known quasars, and extrapolated to the Lyman edge using carefully constructed\\ntemplate SEDs. The simulation is then evolved forward to follow expansion of the ion-\\nization front or proximity zone into the IGM. Multiple sightlines are drawn through the\\nsimulation box, terminating at the quasar’s host halo, and simulated transmission spectra\\nare extracted using the density, temperature, ionization and velocity cubes.\\nThis methodology has been adapted by several groups to place joint constraints on\\nquasar lifetimes and the IGM neutral fraction at z >7 (Bolton et al. 2011, Keating et al.\\n2015, Davies et al. 2018b, Cen & Haiman 2000), and to estimate the ages of z∼6 quasars\\nfrom their proximity zone sizes (Eilers et al. 2017, Bolton & Haehnelt 2007, Chen & Gnedin\\n2021). In ionized proximity zones, the simulations can also be used to calibrate methods to\\nreconstruct the ﬂuctuating density ﬁeld near the central host (Chen et al. 2022).\\nEssentially the simulations are used to generate statistical realizations of the matter\\ndistribution around massive quasar host halos, capturing non-linear physics and scale-\\ndependent correlations in a way that analytic PDFs of the optical depth and/or excursion\\nset formalism cannot accomplish.\\nA completely separate class of simulations is beginning to address challenging questions\\nabout heavy element enrichment of the early IGM and CGM (Keating et al. 2016), for\\ncomparison with observation of heavy element absorption in z > 6 QSO spectra. These\\nsimulations rely on subgrid feedback prescriptions for metal production, which are then\\n34 Fan et al.\\ntransported with standard hydro treatments as at lower redshift. Translation from metal\\nabundances into observable column densities is more complicated than for HI, because the\\nionization balance of multi-level ions depends on the UV background at other, often harder\\nenergies than the Lyman edge. A notable early eﬀort in multi-frequency treatment of\\nan inhomogeneous background is the Technicolor Dawn simulation (Finlator et al. 2018),\\nwhich tracks 24 separate frequencies and measures ionization balances of C IV and Si IV\\nin thez > 5.5 universe, though with a much smaller box size ( L∼12 cMpc) than the\\naforementioned simulations designed to capture quasar host halos.\\n3 4 5 60.1110100\\nO’Meara et al.

Before the discovery of z≳6 quasars, the evolving\\nLyαforest optical depth, which gradually increases with z, had been measured extensively\\nat lower redshifts (Rauch et al. 1997, Becker et al. 2007) and interpreted as a product of\\nthe ¯n∝(1 +z)3density ﬁeld together with a smoothly evolving UV ionizing radiation\\nbackground (Becker & Bolton 2013). Early discoveries of z >6 SDSS quasars (Fan et al.\\n2001) led to a reexamination of underlying assumptions about smooth evolution in XHi\\napproaching reionization. In particular, deep medium-resolution spectroscopy of one of\\nvery ﬁrst such objects — SDSS J1030+0524 at z= 6.3 — revealed a region of Lya forest\\nabsorption consistent with zero ﬂux at wavelengths corresponding to 5 .95< z < 6.16\\n(Becker et al. 2001). This work has been interpreted as the ﬁrst detection of a robust Gunn-\\nPeterson absorption trough, and has been followed by many similar analyses to improve how\\nthe IGM opacity is quantiﬁed (Fan et al. 2006b, Yang et al. 2020a, Bosman et al. 2018,\\nEilers et al. 2018, Becker et al. 2007, Pentericci et al. 2002).\\nThe simplest absorption indicator from a conceptual standpoint is the Ly αopacity,\\nτ=−ln(I/I0), whereI0represents an estimate of the unabsorbed continuum ﬂux level.\\nDeeper spectra of SDSS J1030+0524 and many subsequently discovered objects consistently\\nuncover similar spans of total absorption in Ly αresonance line at z >6, implying a large\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 35\\nlower bound on τlimited only by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spectral data.\\nThis highlights an important challenge in such measurements: the physical information\\nis contained in measuring ﬂux that is notseen. The logarithmic nature of optical depth\\nmeans that even in spectra with SNR ∼100 one can measure limits of τ≳4 (per pixel) at\\nbest, and the zero points can be aﬀected by systematic errors in data reduction, including\\naccurate subtraction night sky emission and correction for telluric absorption. Comparison\\nof observations of the same quasars observed with diﬀerent instruments and reduced with\\ndiﬀerent pipelines indicate discrepancies at the 1–2% ﬂux level, for a mean transmitted ﬂux\\nof 0.5–1.0% at z∼6 (McGreer et al. 2011, Eilers et al. 2018).\\nAdditional dynamic range can often be achieved by observing Ly βor higher order\\ntransitions from the Lyman series. These have progressively decreasing oscillator strengths\\nand require correspondingly larger H icolumn to saturate, allowing access to larger values\\nofτ. This advantage is oﬀset by complications arising from unknown blending with Ly α\\nforest absorption at lower redshift, and uncertainty in extrapolating the intrinsic quasar\\ncontinuum from Ly αto Lyβ.\\nMeasurements of the Ly αopacity are always smoothed to suppress noise and minimize\\nthe eﬀect of diﬀering spectral dispersion and resolution among instruments used in the\\nobservations. Following Fan et al. (2006b), most early studies have used observationally-\\nmotivated redshift bins of ∆ z= 0.15 for ease of comparison, deﬁnining the ”eﬀective optical\\ndepth”τeﬀ=−ln⟨F⟩over the smoothing interval. More recent studies advocate for a\\nphysically-motivated bin size of 50 cMpc, because a constant redshift interval evolves by\\n∼40% in comoving length over 5 <z< 7 where such measurements are made (Eilers et al.\\n2018, Becker et al. 2015). The two values (∆ z= 0.15 and 50 cMpc) are comparable at\\nz∼7. Fig 13 (left panel) presents a recent summary of Ly αoptical depth measurements.\\nAverageτmeasurements are simply the ﬁrst moment of an underlying optical depth\\ndistribution, which contains richer information and has therefore been measured extensively\\nand presented as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of optical depth. Evolution of\\nthe CDF is characterized by three phases, again reﬂecting the logarithmic nature of the\\nmeasurements. At z∼5.0−5.3 the distribution is fairly narrow and centered around\\nτ∼2, corresponding to a Ly αforest with signiﬁcant ( ∼90%) absorption at line resonance,\\nbut not yet fully saturated. At 5 .5< z < 6.0 the CDF widens to span 2 < τ < 6, as an\\nincreasing number of smoothed windows exhibit saturated absorption (i.e. zero transmitted\\nﬂux or high τ), but many signiﬁcant transmission/low neutral fraction windows remain.\\nAbovez>6 it becomes increasingly rare to ﬁnd unsaturated windows with τ <4, and the\\ndistribution once again narrows because spectral SNR renders the τ >6 regime inaccessible.\\nSeveral groups have explored alternative ionization metrics that use counts of trans-\\nmission spikes in the Lya forest, motivated by the many challenges of measuring optical\\ndepths in realistic, heavily absorbed data. Garaldi et al. (2019) constructed distribution\\nfunctionsd2N/dLdz , capturing the density of spikes per cMpc and unit redshift, above a\\nthreshold line ﬂux. These can be counted in spectra of varying resolution and SNR using\\nsimilar techniques as are used for blind searches for metal absorption lines in quasar spectra.\\nTheir analysis indicates that, after accounting for instrumental broadening and noise which\\nsuppress the spike count in realistic observed 5 <z < 6 spectra by an order of magnitude,\\nthe observed spike counts are roughly consistent with their self-consistent simulations of\\nthe post-reionization IGM transmission. In the simulation boxes, transmission spikes arise\\nfrom regions that are under-dense in hydrogen and galaxies, but over-ionized relative to\\nexpectations from equilibrium with the average radiation ﬁeld, likely because of proximity\\n36 Fan et al.\\nto local ionizing sources.\\nAtz >6 one expects transmission spikes to be exceedingly rare, so the detection even\\nof single spikes implies the existence of early ionized cavities. Searches for spikes in high-\\nredshift spectra have yielded several detections at 6 <z < 6.3 that provide upper bounds\\non the local optical depth, complementing the lower bounds derived from measurements of\\nsaturated spectral regions (e.g., Yang et al. 2020a).\\nA very diﬀerent way to conceptualize reionization is as a rapid increase in the mean-\\nfree-path (mfp) of ionizing photons. Although this is physically equivalent to an increase\\nin the volume-averaged ionization fraction, this alternative framing allows a diﬀerent anal-\\nysis approach that does not require high-SNR measurements of localized pixels or spikes.\\nInstead, samples of quasar spectra are stacked after shifting into the rest frame. Then a low-\\ndimensional parametric model is ﬁt to the shape of the stacked spectrum below the Lyman\\nlimit at 912 ˚A, corresponding to a probabilistic ﬂight length of ionizing photons traveling\\nfrom the quasar toward Earth. This model was originally developed at lower redshift to\\nstudy the evolution of the ionizing background far from the background quasar. At high\\nredshift, additional complexity must be added to the model to account for local ionization\\neﬀects near the quasar, since the mean free path can approach the length scale of proximity\\nzones of enhanced ionization around the quasar.\\nFig 13 (right panel) presents the measurements of IGM mpfp using the most recent\\nstacking analyses from Becker et al. (2021). It suggests a rapid change in the mean free\\npath from 8−10 pMpc at z= 5.1 to 0.75−1.5 pMpc atz= 6.0 (the range reﬂects poten-\\ntial ﬂuctuations from cosmic variance/sample size, and also uncertainty in the correlation\\nbetween the H iopacity and ionization rate). This evolution is much stronger than would\\nbe inferred from extrapolation of the evolving mfp at lower redshifts, as one would expect\\nin the late stages of a phase transition like reionization.\\n6.2.3. Dark Gaps and the late stages of reionization. The inverse phenomenon of Ly α\\ntransmission spikes—which trace the ﬁrst environments to complete reionization at z>6—\\nseveral quasar sightlines exhibit long, dark gaps of zero ﬂux at z <6. These gaps are now\\nunderstood to represent residual islands of neutral matter during late-stage reionization.\\nAs ﬁrst explored by Becker et al. (2015) after the discovery of a >110 cMpc dark span\\ntowards the quasar ULAS J0148+0600, measurements of gap length have the advantage of\\nbeing relatively insensitive to the details of estimating the quasar continuum, or absolute\\nﬂux levels. Long gaps are not seen at z∼5, and indeed recent work by Zhu et al. (2021)\\nﬁnds that 90% of quasar spectra at z∼6 have a dark gap of 30 cMpc or longer, but only\\n15% do atz= 5.6.\\nGap statistics have generated signiﬁcant theoretical interest, as they appear to be incon-\\nsistent with numerical models approximating the ionizing UV background ﬁeld as spatially\\nuniform atz= 5.5−6 (Zhu et al. 2021). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain\\nthe phenomenon, including (a) upward ﬂuctuations in gas density (yielding a higher recom-\\nbination rate and neutral fraction), (b) downward ﬂuctuations in the ionizing radiation\\nbackground, or (c) upward ﬂuctuations in galaxy number density, leading to lower-than-\\naverage temperatures (D’Aloisio et al. 2015). The latter scenario is less intuitive, arising\\nfrom a subtle eﬀect where regions of high galaxy density reionize early, and then have more\\ntime to cool oﬀ from the associated photoionization heating. These ﬁrst areas to reionize\\nhave a lower temperature than surrounding regions that reionize later and have not yet\\ncooled. Because the H irecombination rate scales as T−0.7, cooler regions that reionized\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 37\\nearliest would have higher neutral fraction and opacity characteristic of dark gaps.\\nThis yields a testable prediction to distinguish between dark gap models arising from UV\\nbackground versus temperature-driven ﬂuctuations (Davies et al. 2018a). Galaxy surveys\\nalong sightlines with gaps should see an enhancement in galaxy counts relative to the ﬁeld\\nif the gaps arise in cool regions that reionized early; conversely there should be a galaxy\\ndeﬁcit if the gaps arise in islands of enhanced neutral fraction and/or low ionizing radiation\\nbackground (two eﬀects which are not straightforward to distinguish). Christenson et al.\\n(2021), Becker et al. (2018), and Ishimoto et al. (2022) conducted narrowband Lya surveys in\\nﬁelds centered on well-known dark gaps to test this prediction, and found an underdensity of\\nLyman-alpha emitters within 20 h−1Mpc of the quasar sightline, favoring a scenario where\\nthe dark gaps represent residual neutral islands persisting in the late-reionization universe.\\nSpectroscopic galaxy surveys have been diﬃcult and expensive at these redshifts from the\\nground, but early observations with JWST indicate that prospects are very favorable for\\ncorrelating galaxies observed in rest-frame optical emission lines with the IGM Lya opacity.\\nOverall, a consistent picture emerges from a suite of distinct IGM observations using\\nquasar spectra, including (a) the average Ly αoptical depth and its CDF, (b) dark gaps, (c)\\ntransmission spikes, and (d) the mean free path. The ﬁrst three of these four measurements\\nresult from on-resonance Ly αabsorption and the fourth measures the Lyman continuum,\\nmaking them all most useful toward the tail end of reionization at 5 .5<z< 6.3, when the\\nvolume-averaged neutral fraction is ∼10−4, but with signiﬁcant spatial ﬂuctuations. Taken\\ntogether there is evidence that large neutral islands persisted well after z∼6, possibly in\\nregions of low galaxy density and ambient ionizing radiation. During this time there was a\\ntenfold increase in the mean free path for ionizing photons, eventually reaching cosmological\\nlength scales of 10 pMpc or more. The earliest regions to fully reionize can be traced by\\ntransmission spikes at z∼6.3, and are likely to reside in regions of low gas density that\\nhappen by chance to fall near a source of ionizing radiation.\\n6.2.4. Thermal signatures. Ionizing sources emit a spectrum of radiation including photons\\nwith energy above the E > 13.6 eV Hydrogen ionization potential. The excess photon\\nenergy heats the post-reionization IGM, which subsequently cools over time due to adiabatic\\ncosmic expansion. Such heating and cooling is clearly seen during the reionization of He ii\\nat lower redshift (Walther et al. 2019); an even larger eﬀect should be present for Hydrogen\\nreionization. Unfortunately unlike He ii, it is not possible to measure heating from Hydrogen\\nreionization in “real time”, because Gunn-Peterson absorption fully blankets the signal at\\nthe redshifts of interest. Nevertheless the temperature of the IGM at lower redshift—after\\nreionization is complete—still encodes information about the past thermal history.\\nHigh-resolution quasar spectra are excellent thermometers of the IGM, because thermal\\ngas motions projected along the line of sight smooth or broaden absorption features. At\\nlower redshifts where individual unblended lines can be resolved in the Ly αforest, tempera-\\nture maps directly to line proﬁle width through the Voigt proﬁle parameter b=√\\n2kT/m ion,\\nthough this signature is convolved with similar broadening from turbulence and bulk gas\\nmotions.\\nAtz >4.5 it becomes impossible to distinguish individual lines, so the IGM’s temper-\\nature signal must be measured statistically. Eﬀectively, thermal eﬀects impose a low-pass\\nﬁlter on the power spectrum, smoothing out small scale structure in the pattern of Ly α\\ntransmission. The band limit of this ﬁlter is a partly a proxy for the instantaneous tem-\\nperature, but it also retains a memory of past heating, which is partly manifested through\\n38 Fan et al.\\na pressure (i.e. Jeans) broadening beyond the normal Hubble ﬂow. These eﬀects are cali-\\nbrated by statistical comparison to cosmological simulations.\\nThe simulations are generally run on a grid which varies the mean temperature of the\\nIGM at speciﬁed redshifts T0(z), the slope γof the IGM’s temperature-density relation\\nT(∆) =T0∆γ−1, and the thermal energy injected into the IGM during reionization u0,\\nin units of eV per baryon. Synthetic spectra are drawn directly from simulation volumes\\nand run through identical analysis software as the true quasar spectra, to ascertain which\\ncombination of T0,γandu0produce 1D ﬂux power spectra most closely matching observed\\nvalues.\\nUsing these methods, Boera et al. (2019) ﬁnd IGM temperatures of T0= 7000−8000\\nK at 4.2<z < 5.0, which is where the eﬀective optical depth of the forest is 1 <τeﬀ<2,\\nmaking the method most sensitive. Toward higher redshifts where Gunn-Peterson satura-\\ntion begins to manifest, thermal measurements become increasingly challenging. However\\nrecent constraints have been extracted by ﬁtting the widths of emission line spikes, indi-\\ncating slightly higher T0= 10,000−12,000K at earlier times z= 5.3−5.9 as expected\\naccording to the paradigm of heating and adiabatic cooling (Gaikwad et al. 2020).\\nThe simulations can also explore a range of diﬀerent reionization histories to see which\\nparameters best reproduce the post-reionization power spectrum. Toy models of instan-\\ntaneous reionization provide joint constraints on the redshift of thermal injection and its\\namplitude, favoring z∼8−10 as the reionization redshift, and peak post-reionization\\ntemperatures of T= 10,000−20,000 K depending on the choice of ionizing background\\nspectrum. Temperature constraints on the reionization history are limited because the\\nIGM tends to rapidly cool back to its ionization equilibrium temperature, washing out the\\nsignal from the initial thermal impulse. As mentioned above, the rapid thermal broaden-\\ning is accompanied by a pressure broadening that also manifests in the power spectrum,\\nand is somewhat longer lived. It is not possible to fully disentangle pressure and tem-\\nperature smoothing eﬀects from line-of-sight measurements. However measurements made\\nusing pairs of adjacent quasar sightlines can break this degeneracy, since they only measure\\nsmoothing on a transverse spatial scale by construction (Rorai et al. 2017).\\nSummarizing, while the power spectrum and thermal history cannot provide precision\\nconstraints on the timing of hydrogen reionization, it supports a general result that by\\nz∼5, the initial thermal energy injected into the IGM has already cooled substantially, by\\nperhaps a factor of 2 −3. This sets a lower bound on the elapsed time between the period\\nof thermal energy injection and z∼4−5 where the measurements are made. This in turn\\nimplies that the peak heating associated with reionization occurred at 7 <z< 10, broadly\\nconsistent with CMB results reported by Planck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020).\\n6.3. Neutral Hydrogen Absorption in the Quasar Environment\\nEach quasar spectrum oﬀers the opportunity to study radiative feedback in the neighbor-\\nhood of a luminous source of ionizing photons: the background object itself. At 2 <z< 3, a\\nclear deﬁcit is seen in the density of Lyman alpha forest lines as a quasar’s emission redshift\\nis approached (Murdoch et al. 1986, Bajtlik et al. 1988). For these lower redshifts where\\nthe ambient IGM is clearly optically thin, the so-called “proximity eﬀect” reﬂects a local\\nenhancement of ionization in an already highly-ionized medium, and can be used to derive\\nestimates of the quasar’s ionizing ﬂux over the metagalactic background.\\nThis measurement becomes increasingly valuable at high redshift, because the diﬀuse\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 39\\nFigure 14\\nThe size distribution of proximity zones at 5 .9<z< 6.4 (Eilers et al. 2021), versus their host\\nquasar’s absolute magnitude or luminosity.

However the observational manifestation of inter-\\nactions between quasar radiation and the IGM diﬀers according to whether the surrounding\\nmedium has already undergone reionization — in which case one observes a “proximity\\nzone” — or the surrounding medium still has a high neutral fraction — in which case one\\nobserves a damping wing. Both phenomena are now well established; in the sections below\\nwe aim to clarify the distinction between the two, reconcile some diﬀerences in deﬁnitions,\\nand clarify at which redshifts each one is most powerful.\\n6.3.1. Proximity zones and the eﬀects of quasar radiation on recently reionized matter.\\nAtzem∼5.9−6.5, on-resonance (Gunn-Peterson) Ly αhas suﬃcient column density to fully\\nabsorb a quasar’s continuum. However the volume-averaged neutral fraction is only ∼10−4\\nduring late-stage reionization, so a quasar’s local ionization boost can suppress the local\\nLyαopacity to optically thin values τ <1, allowing some ﬂux to transmit at wavelengths\\njust blueward of the Ly αemission line. In exact analogy to the classic proximity eﬀect at\\nlower redshift, these “proximity zones” at z∼6 trace a local ionization enhancement in\\nan already ionized medium. They should not be confused with Str¨ omgren spheres, because\\nthe outside medium has a neutral fraction XHi≪1.\\nThe size of a quasar’s proximity zone depends on its ionizing photon luminosity, its\\nlifetime (i.e. how long it has been shining in a UV-bright phase), and the density and\\n40 Fan et al.\\nionization of the surrounding medium. By convention, observers have deﬁned the proximity\\nzone as the total path from zemto where a quasar’s spectral ﬂux density remains >10%\\nof the continuum level, after smoothing by a boxcar window of width 20 ˚A (Fan et al.\\n2006b). While observationally convenient and consistent, this deﬁnition is not motivated\\nby any physical transition or process. It is loosely related to a radius of enhanced ionizing\\nbackground, but at a 10% ﬂux threshold the enhancement is still very strong — the quasar\\ncontribution exceeds the ambient ﬁeld by an order of magnitude (Eilers et al. 2017). In\\nselect cases one may compare Ly αand Lyβmeasurements to improve dynamic range in\\nanalogous fashion to IGM measurements (Mesinger & Haiman 2004). In this case, one is\\nprobing the sharpness of the boundary of enhanced ionization fraction.\\nUniformly selected samples have yielded typical proximity zone sizes of 2–6 pMpc, with\\na strong (expected) dependence on quasar luminosity, and comparatively weak dependence\\non redshift between 6 .0< z < 6.5 (Eilers et al. 2017, 2020). Intriguingly, after adjusting\\nproximity zone sizes to normalize out the eﬀect of quasar luminosity, Eilers et al. (2017)\\nfound that∼10% of their sample had exceptionally small proximity zones. They argued\\nthat the most likely explanation is that we are observing these quasars before their radiation\\nﬁeld has reached ionization equilibrium with the surrounding IGM, i.e. their current UV-\\nluminous period is t <100,000 years old, with extreme objects even at t <10,000 years\\n(Eilers et al. 2021). Stacking analysis of multiple quasars’ near zones indicates that the\\nmedian quasar lifetime is larger by approximately an order of magnitude (Morey et al.\\n2021). Fig 14 presents a summary of proximity zone size measurements, along with “young\\nquasars” identiﬁed through this type of measurement.\\nIf this interpretation is correct, then proximity zone size distributions can be used to\\nconstrain the UV duty cycle of early quasars. The size is sensitive only to the age of the most\\nrecent or current UV-bright episode, which is not necessarily the ﬁrst in its history. However\\nthe growth timescale problem for building SMBHs at z >6 is well known (see Sec 4; and\\nVolonteri 2010), and this challenge is only exacerbated for any accretion duty cycle below\\nunity. It may be that the usual assumed correspondence between robust accretion and\\nUV-bright episodes may need revision, and signiﬁcant black hole growth can occur during\\na dusty, obscured phase.\\n6.3.2. IGM Damping Wings. As one penetrates deeper into the reionization epoch near\\nz∼7, the ambient neutral fraction increases and the corresponding length scale of proximity\\nzones becomes smaller. When the neutral fraction approaches 1–10%, the eﬀects of oﬀ-\\nresonance Ly αdamping wings become signiﬁcant (Miralda-Escud´ e 1998). Details of this\\nprocess have been reviewed in Mortlock (2016). Brieﬂy, high column densities of neutral\\nhydrogen in the nearby foreground of a quasar lead to a non-negligible probability that a\\nphoton emitted redward of Ly αin the quasar’s rest frame will still be absorbed by neutral\\nintergalactic matter en route to Earth. This last fact is critical—in the far-foreground Ly α\\nforest region there is an unresolvable degeneracy at any wavelength between oﬀ-resonance\\ndamping wing absorption from neutral gas, and on-resonance absorption from ionized gas\\nat a diﬀerent redshift. In contrast, absorption redward of the Ly αemission line can only\\ncome from oﬀ-resonance interactions.\\nThe IGM damping signature is expected around quasars meeting two conditions: they\\nhave recently turned on, and are embedded in an IGM with high global neutral fraction.\\nIn contrast to z∼6 proximity zones that have already been pre-ionized by surrounding\\ngalaxies, the z∼7 quasars with damping wings are driving true ionization fronts into the\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 41\\nFigure 15\\nDamping wing measurements for J0252-0503 ( z= 7.00).

Gas closer to the quasar is inside the ionization front,\\nso its neutral fraction is too low to produce oﬀ-resonance Ly αabsorption wings. Gas that\\nis far outside the ionization front can produce oﬀ-resonance absorption, but its line-of-sight\\nvelocity oﬀset is too large for the oﬀ-resonance wing to produce appreciable optical depth\\nredward of Lya emission.\\nDamping wing measurements are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by systematic uncertainties in\\nmodeling the detailed shape of quasars’ intrinsic Ly αproﬁle. Diﬀerent groups have tackled\\nthis challenge using training sets of low-redshift SDSS or HST/COS spectra where the Ly α\\nemission proﬁle and unabsorbed continuum can be estimated more reliably. The objective\\nis to predict the unabsorbed Ly αemission line shape and forest continuum (and associated\\nuncertainties) using pixels to the red of the quasar’s Ly αemission line.\\nMultiple groups have used Principal Component Analysis (Davies et al. 2018c, Mort-\\nlock et al. 2011), Machine/Deep Learning models (Liu & Bordoloi 2021), Neural Networks\\n(ˇDurovˇ c´ ıkov´ a et al. 2020), covariance matrices (Greig et al. 2017, 2022), stacking of nearest-\\nneighbor observed spectra (Simcoe et al. 2012, Bosman & Becker 2015, Bosman et al. 2021),\\nor other hybrid approaches to train and validate continuum+Ly αsoftware on lower redshift\\nquasars. Most methods also calculate some envelope of formal uncertainty on the contin-\\nuum estimate before applying them to z∼7 quasar spectra. When comparing diﬀerent\\nreconstruction techniques in the Ly α/Lyβforest region and around the Ly αemission line,\\nthe diﬀerence between continuum models for the same object using diﬀerent codes often\\nexceeds expectations from their formal error estimates, indicating the presence of residual\\nsystematics. It has therefore been important to test observations of the same objects taken\\n42 Fan et al.\\nusing diﬀerent instruments and analysis software to build conﬁdence in the fundamental\\nconclusion about damping wing strengths and the neutral fraction. Fig 15 illustrates some\\nof the diﬀerent techniques in predicting the quasar intrinsic spectrum in the damping wing\\nregion of a quasar at z= 7.0.\\nWhile it is impossible to know if any particular continuum realization is “correct”, a con-\\nsensus is indeed emerging that certain speciﬁc objects — most notably ULASJ1342+0928\\n(z= 7.54; Ba˜ nados et al. 2018), DESJ0252 −0503 (z= 7.00; Wang et al. 2020), J1007+2115\\n(z= 7.51; Yang et al. 2020b) and ULASJ1120+0641 ( z= 7.09; Mortlock et al. 2011) —\\nshow strong evidence for IGM damping wings for all continuum models explored in the\\nliterature. Various analyses derive slightly diﬀerent IGM neutral fractions for the same\\nobjects on account of modeling diﬀerences (Greig et al. 2022, 2019, Davies et al. 2018b,\\nBolton et al. 2011). But a robust result remains that 67% of known quasars at z > 7\\nhave (a) negligible proximity zone sizes, and (b) ﬂux measurements at wavelengths slightly\\nredder than the Lya emission line that fall below all continuum reconstructions based on\\nlow-redshift quasars. This combination of small proximity zone and damping wing has not\\nbeen measured in a single quasar at z <7, despite the much larger sample sizes available\\nfor testing.\\nBecause most of the damping wing is generated just outside the ionized bubble, there\\nis a risk that the same signature could arise from chance alignment of a classical damped\\nLyαabsorber (i.e. from the ISM of a bound proto-galaxy) near the quasar in an otherwise\\nionized IGM (Section 6.5). Indeed there are examples of such “proximate DLAs” in the\\nliterature, including several at z > 6. The a priori odds of such a chance alignment are\\nsmall, but were considered carefully in studies of the ﬁrst damping wing (Simcoe et al.\\n2012). There are two arguments now suggesting that this phenomenon is not aﬀecting IGM\\nmeasurements at z>7. First, none of the four sightlines listed above exhibit heavy-element\\nabsorption at the redshift of the putative DLA, to very sensitive limits. Second, the presence\\nof damping wings in multiple new z>7 discoveries points to a global phenomenon, as the\\njoint probability of seeing proximate DLAs in all of these becomes lower still. With very\\nhigh-SNR data it is in principle possible to distinguish between DLA absorption from the\\ncondensed CGM/ISM of a proto-galaxy and an extended patch of neutral but gravitationally\\nunbound IGM using the damping proﬁle alone. However no studies at present have claimed\\nsuch a detection.\\nA ﬁnal unknowable factor in damping wing analysis is the spatial distribution of gas\\ndensity and accompanying ﬂuctuations in ionization inside and outside the proximity zone.\\nEarly papers used analytic models based on distribution functions of overdensity, and as-\\nsumed that the gas was in ionization equilibrium with a uniform background radiation ﬁeld\\n(Mortlock et al. 2011, Simcoe et al. 2012). Later and more sophisticated treatments have\\ndrawn distributions of sightlines from cosmological simulations to capture the line-of-sight\\nvariations in density and ionization (Greig et al. 2019). Large simulation boxes are required\\nfor this method, to identify the rare, high-mass halos where early quasars are thought to\\nreside. Many sightlines are constructed which terminate by design at the high-mass halo,\\nto generate many realizations of the damping wing for diﬀerent viewing orientations.\\nSummarizing, among all quasar absorption methods, IGM damping wings yield the\\nonly two-sided constraint on XHiatz >5.7, and are therefore one of our most important\\nprobes of reionization history. They are nevertheless subject to substantial, and probably\\nunresolvable systematic uncertainties concerning quasar continuum shape and details of the\\ndensity and ionization ﬁelds around each quasar. Nevertheless a tentative consensus has\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 43\\n0.20.40.60.81.0\\nLyα+β Dark Pixels\\nMcGreer+2015\\nJin+2022\\nQuasar Damping Wings\\nGreig+2017\\nBañados+2018\\nDavies+2018\\nGreig+2019Wang+2020\\nYang+2020b\\nGreig+2022\\nReionization History\\nPlanck 2018 (FlexKnot Model)\\nRobertson et al., 2015\\nFinkelstein et al., 2019\\nNaidu et al., 2020Dark Gaps\\nLyα+β\\n(Zhu+2022)\\n5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5\\nRedshift z10-510-410-310-2\\nIGM Neutral Hydrogen Fraction xHILyα Forest τeff\\nFan+2006\\nYang+2020a\\nBosman+2021Figure 16\\nSummary of quasar absorption constraints on the reionization history (all data points; Figure\\nadapted from Jin et al. 2022).

Adding more objects will potentially\\nincrease conﬁdence in the result, but may not reduce its fractional uncertainty to better than\\n±40%, since the uncertainty envelope is dominated by model assumptions and is therefore\\nnot random.\\nStill this result is extremely signiﬁcant because any measurement placing XHi∼50% (or\\nat a similar order of magnitude) represents a working deﬁnition of the reionization midpoint.\\nFig 16 summarizes the various reionization constraints from diﬀerent quasar absorption\\nobservations, compared with both constraints from the measuremnts of CMB polarization\\n(Robertson et al. 2015) and a number of empirical reionization history models. Optical\\ndepth measurements provide one-sided lower limits on XHiatz <6.3, transmission spikes\\nprovide one-sided upper limits at 5 .5< z < 6.5, and damping wings provided two-sided\\nconstraints with large errors at 7 <z< 7.5. This combination of limits and measurements\\npermits models with a range of reionization histories with midpoints centered anywhere from\\n6.5<z < 8.0. Future 21-cm experiments will potentially measure these values with more\\nprecision and accuracy; these quasar constraints will help such experiments optimize their\\nredshift window. Still, when expressed in terms of lookback time rather than redshift, quasar\\nabsorption constraints correspond to a 1–2% measurement of the timing of reionization, to\\n94.5+0.9\\n−0.5% lookback, or 760+80\\n−120Myr after the Big Bang.\\n6.4. Heavy Element Enrichment of Intervening Quasar Absorbers\\nThe radiative feedback that drove reionization was accompanied by chemical feedback that\\ncan also be observed in the spectra of high redshift quasars. At z > 6, large samples of\\nhigh-resolution quasar spectra taken with VLT/XShooter, Magellan/FIRE, Keck/NIRES\\nand Gemini/GNIRS have revealed foreground heavy element absorption lines redward of\\n44 Fan et al.\\nLyαwhere the quasar’s continuum can be easily modeled. Because H iis saturated in the\\nLyαforest atz >6, metal absorption lines provide the only accessible information about\\ndiﬀuse gas at these epochs.\\nAbsorption strength in these papers is sometimes reported as column density Nionand\\nother times as a rest-frame equivalent width Wr. The IR spectrographs listed above have\\nintrinsic resolutions of ∆ v∼50 km/s or coarser, which is insuﬃcient to resolve the ﬁne\\n5−10 km/s velocity structure seen in metal-line absorbers at lower redshift. Equivalent\\nwidth measurements are therefore conservative and will be consistently measured across all\\nspectrographs. Column densities are easier to interpret physically, but must be approached\\nwith care, accounting for the possibility of unresolved saturation in the line core, or blend-\\ning of unresolved components. The detection sensitivity of current spectrographs limits\\nmetal line analyses to column densities characteristic of circumgalactic gas at lower red-\\nshift. Deeper spectra or statistical stacks will be needed to search for metals in the diﬀuse\\nIGM.\\nEarly studies of heavy element enrichment in the reionization epoch (Simcoe et al. 2011,\\nD’Odorico et al. 2013, Ryan-Weber et al. 2006, Becker et al. 2009, Simcoe 2006) focused\\non the C ivdoublet, which is the most ubiquitous IGM metal line at lower redshifts and a\\ntracer of highly-ionized circumgalactic gas. At z >5.5 Civshifts into the Jband. Most\\nsurveys focus on a similar set of observables, including the comoving absorption density\\ndN/dX1, and the equivalent width distribution d2N/dXdW .\\nThese surveys established that the frequency of C ivabsorbers decreases toward higher\\nredshift, such that individual C ivsystems become rare at z >6 — most sightlines have\\nno C ivdoublets in this range. For example, Codoreanu et al. (2018) surveyed deep spec-\\ntra of four quasar sightlines, ﬁnding a four-fold decrease in comoving line density dN/dX\\nbetweenz= 4.8 andz= 5.7, and zero detections above z > 6, consistent with earlier\\nbut smaller studies in the literature (Simcoe et al. 2011). There is very tentative evidence\\nof a steepening in the column density distribution function (CDDF) f(N) =d2N/dNdX ,\\nbecause of diﬀerential evolution of the strongest C ivabsorbers at high redshift. However\\nthese analyses still utilize modest numbers of sightlines ( <10), so shot noise and saturation\\nbecome signiﬁcant limitations at the high- Wrend. There are now relatively large samples\\nof high quality spectra for z>6.5 quasars, which should lead to improved estimates of the\\nCDDF and C ivevolution in the near future.\\nEvolving enrichment levels are sometimes summarized in terms of the C ivcontribu-\\ntion to closure density Ω CIV, which is a mass-weighted integral of the CDDF. Like dN/dX\\nor the normalization of f(N), Ω CIVdeclines toward higher redshift. While it is conve-\\nnient to express global metal enrichment in terms of this single number, the power-law\\nslopef(N)∝N−1.5of the CDDF is shallower than α=−2, implying that the integral∫\\nNf(N)dNdiverges toward high column densities. The single strongest absorber in any\\nsample therefore dominates the integral, meaning that by construction Ω CIVis aﬀected by\\nshot noise and pathlength searched.\\nThe disappearance of C ivat high redshift could be driven either by a decline in heavy\\nelement abundances, or by a change in ionization. If abundance evolution predominates one\\n1The quantity dX=dz√\\nΩM(1 +z)3+ ΩΛis equivalent to a redshift path at z= 0, but accounts\\nfor pure cosmological evolution in the comoving radial line element. A population of absorbers with\\nconstant product n(z)σof comoving space density n(z) and absorption cross section σwill have a\\nconstantdN/dX at all redshifts.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 45\\nFigure 17\\n(Left) Evolution in number density dN/dX of heavy element absorption systems, illustrating the\\ndiﬀerent behavior between highly ionized species C ivand SiIV, which decline with increasing\\nredshift, and low-ionization species Mg iiand OI, which do not decline. (Right) A stack of z>5.7\\nabsorbers selected individually by MgII detection, which shows other low-ionization lines, but no\\nevidence of C ivor SiIV.\\nmight also expect to see a decline in the frequency of low-ionization species such as Mg ii,\\nOI, SiII, CII, or FeII. However there have been robust detections of all these low-ionization\\nlines atz >6, suggesting an important change in the ionization state of metal absorption\\nline systems coincident with the reionization of intergalactic hydrogen.\\nThe ﬁrst detections of low-ionization metal absorption at z > 6 focused on the OI\\n1302, CII 1334, and SiII 1260 lines, which have rest wavelengths only slightly to the red of\\nLyαand can therefore be detected in high-resolution optical (rather than infrared) spectra\\n(Becker et al. 2011). However the small oﬀset between these and Ly αalso leaves a very\\nshort search pathlength per sightline; if they are too far in the quasar’s foreground these\\nlines fall within the H iGunn-Peterson trough and become impossible to detect.\\nWith improved IR spectra it became possible to search systematically for low-ionization\\nMgiidoublets at z >6, albeit with complex selection windows caused by broadband at-\\nmospheric absorption between the J/H andH/K bands, discrete telluric absorption, and\\nbright hydroxyl emission lines. After accounting for these eﬀects, Mg iisurveys ﬁnd trends\\nconsistent with the other neutral ions—there is no clear evolution in the comoving line den-\\nsitydN/dX for systems with Wr>0.3˚A (although if one restricts to very strong absorbers,\\nthere is a slight excess at z∼3; Chen et al. 2017, Matejek & Simcoe 2012). Mg iiabsorbers\\nare now detected out to the highest known redshift of an absorption system, at z= 6.84\\n(Simcoe et al. 2020).\\nThe statistical decrease in C ivfrequency together with statistical non-evolution of low-\\nionization species requires that as reionization is approached, one should eventually ﬁnd\\nindividual absorbers with CII, OI, SiII, and Mg iibut no detection of a highly ionized C iv\\n46 Fan et al.\\nphase. This is indeed the case; in fact such low-ionization-only systems predominate at\\nz>6, composing over 2/3 of all metal line absorbers (Cooper et al. 2019).\\nIn sharp contrast, “low-ionization only” absorbers are exceedingly rare at all redshifts\\nz < 5.5, indicating a qualitative change in the CGM’s observable properties during the\\nreionization epoch. At 2 < z < 4 OI, CII, and SiII are much more rare than C iv; nearly\\nevery known low-ionization absorber is accompanied by stronger C ivand SiIV lines oﬀset by\\n<100 km/s, and there are many examples of C ivwith no low-ionization lines (Cooper et al.\\n2019). Because absorption surveys are cross-section selected, the canonical interpretation is\\nthat ionized C ivtraces a widespread low-density CGM, while OI, CII, and SiII trace cooled\\nand condensed clumps in the ISM of a nearby galaxy, or small, cold precipitates embedded\\nin the warm ionized CGM (Stern et al. 2016). The evolution of the number density of heavy\\nelement absorption systems is summarized in Fig 17.\\nThe observational disappearance of the ionized CGM implies that during this epoch\\nwhere galaxies are in early assembly, their circumgalactic gas has not yet been enriched to\\nobservable levels, and/or the ambient radiation ﬁeld is insuﬃcient in intensity or hardness to\\nmaintain a high degree of ionization. Unfortunately it is impossible to calculate abundances\\ndirectly at z > 6, because H icolumn density measurement is prevented by the Gunn-\\nPeterson trough. However the number density of these low-ionization metal lines is similar\\nto extrapolations of dN/dX for DLAs and sub-DLAs (Cooper et al. 2019, Becker et al.\\n2019) and is either ﬂat or slightly increasing at earlier times. If one assumes H icolumn\\ndensities in this range ( NHI>1019.8), the detected low-ionization lines are consistent with\\na metallicity of [C/H] ∼−2.3, in a warm neutral medium. If there exists a warm ionized\\nmedium of similar metallicity in pressure equilibrium with the warm neutral phase, it would\\nbe clearly detected in C iv. To evade detection, the ionized medium must have ∼100×lower\\nabundance, or [C/H] <−4 (Simcoe et al. 2020). If the heavy elements seen in low ionization\\nlines are produced locally to that environment, this implies that those metals have not yet\\nbeen mixed into the ionized CGM. Evidently the galactic environments traced by z > 6\\nmetal absorbers bear some resemblance to metal-poor DLAs at lower redshifts, but they\\nare at an early and immature stage of chemical evolution and mixing.\\n6.5. Metal Absorption in the Vicinity of QSO Hosts\\nAt all redshifts one can ﬁnd a rare but important class of metal absorbers in the immediate\\nforeground of their respective quasar hosts (Prochaska et al. 2008). These “proximate\\nDLAs” have a special importance, and four have been discovered at z >6. They are the\\nonly discrete absorbers in the reionization epoch for which it is possible to constrain NHI\\ndirectly using the oﬀ-resonance wing. Because DLAs with NHI>1020.3cm−3are self-\\nshielded and largely neutral, the pDLAs therefore also permit direct measurement of heavy\\nelement abundances, with no ionization correction needed.\\nThe pDLAs are distinguished from IGM damping wings on the basis of coincident metal\\nabsorption. They are also found at lower redshift than the four z >7 IGM damping wing\\ncandidates—two pDLAs are at z∼6.3−6.4 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2019b, Andika et al. 2022), one\\natz∼6 (Davies 2020), and one is at z= 5.93, 40 kpc from a galaxy detected with ALMA\\nat coincident redshift (D’Odorico et al. 2018). At these redshifts no other quasars have\\nexhibited metal-free damping wings, and many observations of transmission spikes indicate\\nthat reionization is well underway (Yang et al. 2020a).\\nThe pDLAs studied by Ba˜ nados et al. (2019b) and D’Odorico et al. (2018) have abun-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 47\\ndances near 0 .001Z⊙, which would place them amongst the most metal poor DLAs known\\nat lower redshift (Cooke et al. 2011). Neither shows evidence for anomalies in relative\\nabundances, as might be expected from a medium enriched with Population III supernova\\ndebris. High ionization C ivand SiIV are not reported in either system, consistent with\\nthe discussion in the previous section about the disappearance of the high-ionization CGM\\nphase. This has been cited as evidence that the pDLA originates outside of the quasar\\nhost, where the UV radiation ﬁeld should be enhanced and an ionized medium would be\\nexpected.\\nThe evidence so far suggests that pDLAs in the reionization epoch are representative\\nof randomly intervening metal absorbers at similar redshift.\\n7. Summary\\nSince the ﬁrst discoveries of reionization-era quasars more than twenty years ago, tremen-\\ndous progress has been made in extending the frontiers of quasar research deeper into the\\ncosmic dawn, in characterizing and understanding these objects in the context of early\\nSMBH growth and galaxy formation, and in using them as beacons to shed light on the\\nevolution of the IGM and the history of cosmic reionization.\\nSUMMARY POINTS\\n1. The current frontier of quasar research is at z∼7.6, with a large statistical sample\\nassembled at redshifts up to 7. High-redshift quasar selection is a challenging data\\nmining problem because of the rarity of the targets, the limited training sets, and\\nthe overwhelmingly large number of contaminant sources, both astrophysical and\\ninstrumental. We provide a database of the properties of all published quasars at\\nz>5.3 asSupplementary Material that accompanies this review.\\n2. The rapid evolution of the quasar LF has been well established. However, the\\nexact shape of the LF is still uncertain, both at the high luminosity end due to\\nsmall number statistics, and at the low luminosity end due to limitations of deep\\nsurveys. In sharp contrast, early quasars “look” almost identical to their low-\\nredshift counterparts in spectral properties. Even the earliest known quasars have\\na well-established AGN structure.\\n3. There are more than 100 z≳6 quasars with robust BH mass measurements. Their\\nmasses range from ∼4×107M⊙to∼1010M⊙. The BHs are growing at high Ed-\\ndington ratios ( λEﬀ,median = 0.79 andλEﬀ,mean = 0.92), with mild evidence of an\\nincrease of the accretion rate for z≳6.5 quasars in comparison to luminosity-\\nmatched quasar samples at lower redshifts.\\n4. The UV stellar light in z∼6 quasar hosts remains undetected, while on the other\\nhand, (sub)mm observations have revealed the existence of copious amounts of gas\\nand cold dust in many of these galaxies. Quasar hosts are massive, star-forming\\ngalaxies showing diverse morphology and kinematics; their average dynamical mass\\nappears lower than that based on the local scaling relation between BH and galaxy\\nmasses.\\n5. Lyαabsorption in quasars’ foreground IGM provides many of the most stringent\\nconstraints on the history of reionization, though the details of the observations\\nvary with redshift. Toward the end of reionization at z<6, counts of transmission\\n48 Fan et al.\\nspikes, dark gaps, and pixel optical depths indicate that universe is mostly ionized,\\nbut may harbor substantial islands of neutral matter as late as z∼5.3. Atz >7,\\nfour quasars have been discovered with prominent, metal-free damping wings that\\nare thought to represent oﬀ-resonance absorption from an IGM with neutral fraction\\n>10%, and possibly as high as 80%.\\n6. Heavy element absorption is seen in quasar spectra well into the epoch of reioniza-\\ntion, tracing chemical feedback from stars whose radiation is also transforming the\\nglobal ionization balance. It appears that these absorbers are high-redshift, low-\\nmetallicity analogs of damped Ly αabsorbers observed at lower redshift. However\\nthe highly ionized phase of the circumgalactic medium, seen universally in CIV at\\nz <6, abruptly vanishes in the EoR. This either indicates that the metals in the\\nCGM are undergoing their own ionization transition, or that the ionized phase of\\nthe CGM has not yet been enriched with heavy elements at z>6.\\nFUTURE ISSUES\\n1. With the new facilities planned for the next decade, we expect the quasar redshift\\nfrontier to reach redshift 9–10, when the ﬁrst generation of luminous quasars is\\nforming. A key challenge will be the spectroscopic conﬁrmation of these faint high-\\nredshift sources.\\n2. SMBH mass measurements using the H βline with JWST and gas-dynamical esti-\\nmates with ALMA (and eventually the ngVLA) will provide more accurate measure-\\nments than what is currently possible. These results will be crucial to test whether\\nthe current methods calibrated at low redshift (e.g., Mg iisingle-epoch virial mass)\\nstill hold at the highest accessible redshifts. To measure the BH masses of the pro-\\ngenitors of the currently observed z= 6−7 quasar population, NIR spectroscopic\\nfollow-up with the ELTs will be key.\\n3. JWST will likely be able to ﬁnally reveal stellar light from z≳6 quasar hosts.\\nALMA will continue playing a critical role in understanding and characterizing the\\ninterstellar medium of quasar host galaxies via multi-line diagnostics.\\n4. New quasar samples uncovered by Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope and\\nobserved with JWST and ELTs should substantially improve conﬁdence in z≥7\\nmeasurements of IGM damping wings. They will allow studies even deeper into the\\npast.\\n5. JWST already shows promise of being transformative for surveys of galaxies in ﬁelds\\nwhere high-redshift quasars have been used to constrain the IGM density ﬁeld. This\\nmay open the possibility of studying cross-correlations between Ly α, metals, and\\ngalaxies.\\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\\nThe authors are not aware of any aﬃliations, memberships, funding, or ﬁnancial holdings\\nthat might be perceived as aﬀecting the objectivity of this review.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 49\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe dedicate this review to the memory of Professor Maarten Schmidt, who passed away in\\nSeptember 2022 at the age of 92.

While the near-infrared (NIR) variability of Sgr A* was shown to be consistent\\nover two decades, unprecedented activity in 2019 challenges existing statistical models. We investigate\\nthe origin of this activity by re-calibrating and re-analyzing all of our Keck Observatory Sgr A* imaging\\nobservations from 2005-2022. We present light curves from 69 observation epochs using the NIRC2\\nimager at 2.12 µm with laser guide star adaptive optics. These observations reveal that the mean\\nluminosity of Sgr A* increased by a factor of ∼3 in 2019, and the 2019 light curves had higher variance\\nthan in all time periods we examined. We find that the 2020-2022 flux distribution is statistically\\nconsistent with the historical sample and model predictions, but with fewer bright measurements\\nabove 0.6 mJy at the ∼2σlevel. Since 2019, we have observed a maximum Ks(2.2µm) flux of 0.9\\nmJy, compared to the highest pre-2019 flux of 2.0 mJy and highest 2019 flux of 5.6 mJy. Our results\\nsuggest that the 2019 activity was caused by a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr A*, possibly due\\nto delayed accretion of tidally-stripped gas from the gaseous object G2 in 2014. We also examine faint\\nSgr A* fluxes over a long time baseline to search for a quasi-steady quiescent state. We find that Sgr\\nA* displays flux variations over a factor of ∼500, with no evidence for a quiescent state in the NIR.\\nKeywords: black hole physics, accretion, Galaxy: center, techniques: high angular resolution\\n1.INTRODUCTION\\nThe Milky Way’s Galactic center harbors the nearest\\nsupermassive black hole, providing a natural laboratory\\nfor detailed study of physical processes in its vicinity\\n(e.g. Sch¨ odel et al. 2003; Ghez et al. 2008). Observations\\nat radio, infrared, and X-ray wavelengths have revealed\\nthe Galactic black hole, Sgr A*, to be a continuously\\nvariable source (e.g. Falcke 1999; Baganoff et al. 2001;\\nGenzel et al. 2003). The detailed nature of the vari-\\nable emission can provide important constraints on how\\ngas is captured from the black hole’s surrounding envi-\\nronment, as well as on the physical phenomena taking\\nplace within the accretion flow as the matter approaches\\nCorresponding author: Grant C. Weldon\\ngweldon@astro.ucla.eduthe event horizon (e.g., reconnection events, hydrody-\\nnamic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, shocks,\\nand lensing caustics). While accretion processes have\\nbeen extensively studied in highly luminous active galac-\\ntic nuclei, Sgr A* is an example of the ubiquitous pop-\\nulation of low-luminosity galactic nuclei in the nearby\\nuniverse. By studying Sgr A*, we can learn more about\\naccretion processes in these systems (for recent reviews\\nsee Genzel et al. 2010; Morris et al. 2012).\\nNear-infrared (NIR) observations are particularly ef-\\nfective for monitoring the variability of Sgr A*. While\\nthe radio band traces small variations in the bulk ac-\\ncretion flow and the X-ray band is only sensitive to\\nstrong flares that rise above the extended local back-\\nground at the Galactic center, the resolved NIR source\\nshows both large and small variations that can almost\\nalways be detected using adaptive optics on the largestarXiv:2308.09749v1  [astro-ph.GA]  18 Aug 2023\\n2\\nground-based telescopes (e.g. Hornstein et al. 2002; Gen-\\nzel et al. 2003; Ghez et al. 2004; Meyer et al. 2014). The\\nNIR emission arises primarily from synchrotron radia-\\ntion very close ( ≲15 Schwarzschild radii) to the event\\nhorizon and can be used to bridge the radio and X-ray\\nbands to construct a coherent description of the emission\\nprocesses in radiatively-inefficient, advection-dominated\\nblack hole accretion flows (e.g. Fazio et al. 2018; Witzel\\net al. 2021).\\nThere have been numerous efforts to statistically char-\\nacterize the NIR variability. Do et al. (2009) showed\\nthat light curves from 2005-2007 can be described by a\\nred-noise process that is correlated in time and does not\\nexhibit periodicity or quasi-periodicity. Using observa-\\ntions from 2004-2009, Dodds-Eden et al. (2011) found\\nthe data to be described by a two-state model with a\\nlow-level log-normal component and a separate power-\\nlaw tail for flares. On the other hand, a recent com-\\nprehensive analysis of over 13,000 measurements of Sgr\\nA* flux density with Keck data at 2.12 µm (2003-2014)\\nand VLT and Spitzer data at 4.5 µm (2004-2017) found\\nthat the NIR time variability can indeed be consistently\\ndescribed by red noise, but that the entire distribution\\nof fluxes is well-fit by a single log-normal model without\\na separate flaring component (Witzel et al. 2018). By\\nre-analyzing speckle data from Keck (1995-2005), Chen\\net al. (2019) extended the time baseline of Sgr A* obser-\\nvations and showed that the statistical model of Witzel\\net al. (2018) remained consistent with the data over two\\ndecades through 2018.\\nHowever, in May 2019 Do et al. (2019) observed an\\nunprecedented bright NIR event with Keck. The flux of\\nSgr A* varied by a factor of 75 over a 2-hour timescale\\nand reached twice the level of any previous historical\\nNIR measurement. The maximum fluxes were observed\\nat the beginning of observations, suggesting that Sgr A*\\nwas likely even brighter prior to taking measurements\\nthat night. With additional bright events observed at\\nKeck in 2019, Do et al. (2019) showed the 2019 activ-\\nity to be inconsistent with the historical flux distribu-\\ntion of Witzel et al. (2018). Additionally, a high abun-\\ndance of bright NIR events were observed with VLT\\nin 2019 relative to other years (Gravity Collaboration\\net al. 2020). Heightened activity was also seen in the ra-\\ndio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al. 2022;\\nCheng et al. 2023) and X-ray regimes (e.g. Pavlinsky\\n2019; Degenaar et al. 2019). These observations collec-\\ntively suggest that Sgr A* displayed unusual behavior\\nin 2019, making this era useful for understanding the\\ntime-variable accretion flow onto the black hole.Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the\\nelevated 2019 activity. These possibilities and their ob-\\nservable signatures include the following.\\n1. The statistical models of Sgr A* in the NIR need\\nto be updated to capture the bright events. While\\nWitzel et al. (2018) found that historical mea-\\nsurements follow a single log-normal distribution,\\nGravity Collaboration et al. (2020) argues that\\nthe 2019 bright events observed by Keck and VLT\\nare rare events drawn from the power-law tail of\\nthe underlying two-state distribution described by\\nDodds-Eden et al. (2011). In such two-state mod-\\nels, the faint distribution arises from steady accre-\\ntion of mass from the black hole’s environment,\\nand the flaring state arises from a separate pro-\\ncess that injects additional energy. A related ques-\\ntion concerns whether there exists a quasi-steady,\\nquiescent “floor” to the Sgr A* light curves or\\nwhether Sgr A* displays similar variability char-\\nacteristics at both faint and high levels (e.g. Do\\net al. 2009). Previous studies have historically\\nbeen complicated by short time baselines or have\\nnot closely examined the faint end of the flux dis-\\ntribution. We can examine Sgr A* at low flux\\ndensities over a long time baseline to determine\\nwhether such a quiescent state exists and to study\\nwhether the statistical character of the emission\\nat faint flux densities is simply an extension of\\nwhat we see at higher flux densities. We can also\\nstudy whether the faint flux densities are different\\nin 2019 than in other years. If the 2019 events\\nare indicative of a power-law “flaring” state dis-\\ntinct from the log-normal “quiescent” state, we\\nshould see only the flaring state affected and the\\nfaint end of the flux distribution unchanged be-\\ntween 2019 and other years. A shift in the faint\\nend of the flux distribution in 2019 would instead\\nsuggest that Sgr A* experienced a physical change\\nduring this time.\\n2. There was a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr\\nA*. The Galactic center hosts a population of\\nstars and dusty G-objects, which could affect the\\naccretion flow. The star S0-2 underwent closest\\napproach in 2018, and its passage may have in-\\nduced an accretion disturbance (Loeb 2004). In\\nthe past two decades, the objects G1 and G2 un-\\nderwent closest approach and showed signs of tidal\\ninteraction with the black hole, causing much spec-\\nulation about the potential for excess material\\nfrom these objects to induce heightened Sgr A*\\nactivity (e.g. Gillessen et al. 2012; Phifer et al.\\n3\\n2013; Eckart et al. 2013; Witzel et al. 2014; Pfuhl\\net al. 2015; Witzel et al. 2017; Plewa et al. 2017;\\nGillessen et al. 2019). While an increase in X-ray\\nflares was reported following G2’s passage in 2014\\n(Ponti et al. 2015), no exceptional NIR activity\\nwas reported in the years immediately following\\n2014. However, it is possible that there is a larger\\ntime delay between the passage of G2 and any ob-\\nserved NIR activity (e.g Kawashima et al. 2017;\\nMurchikova 2021). If a neighboring source, such as\\nS0-2 or G2, deposited gas or altered the accretion\\nflow onto Sgr A*, we would expect to see height-\\nened activity for the duration of time it takes that\\nmaterial to fall into the black hole, followed by a\\nreturn to more typical behavior.\\n3. Sgr A* has entered a new accretion state in which\\nbright flares are more common, or the 2019 ac-\\ntivity is a precursor to an even larger event (Do\\net al. 2019). Observations of X-ray light echoes\\nfrom iron line emission at the Galactic center sug-\\ngest that in the past several hundred years, Sgr\\nA* has undergone multiple ( ∼2-10 year) luminos-\\nity increases by factors of up to 105(e.g. Ponti\\net al. 2010; Clavel et al. 2013; Terrier et al. 2018;\\nChuard et al. 2018). If Sgr A* is undergoing a state\\nchange or entering an extreme episode, we should\\nsee the activity of Sgr A* continue or evolve in the\\nyears beyond 2019.\\nTo test these hypotheses, we must compare the be-\\nhavior of Sgr A* before, during, and after 2019 at both\\nlow and high flux densities. Previous studies used dif-\\nferent photometric methods (e.g. aperture photometry,\\npoint spread function fitting, interferometry) and vary-\\ning treatments for stellar contamination of Sgr A*, mak-\\ning the comparison of absolute flux densities unreliable,\\nespecially at fainter levels. In this work, we present\\nSgr A* observations using Keck Observatory from 2005-\\n2022, all reduced with the same methodology, allowing\\nfor a robust comparison of flux densities over time. This\\nstudy includes re-reduced data from Witzel et al. (2018)\\nand Do et al. (2019), as well as newly presented histor-\\nical data (2005-2017; Sgr A* is confused by the bright\\nstar S0-2 in 2018) and more recent observations taken\\nin 2019 and from 2020-2022. Section 2 describes these\\nobservations and data reduction. Section 3 presents the\\nanalysis of the flux distributions, comparisons to the his-\\ntorical model, characteristics of the light curves, and\\ntiming analyses. Section 4 discusses the physical impli-\\ncations of our results. We conclude in Section 5.\\n2.OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION2.1. Keck observations\\nOur observations of the Galactic center were taken\\nwith the Keck 2 Telescope using the narrow camera in\\nthe Near-Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2) imager with the\\nLaser-Guide Star Adaptive Optics (LGS AO) system\\n(Wizinowich et al. 2006). All of the Keck observations\\nin this work were taken with the K′filter (2.12 µm).\\nIndividual K′images consist of 10 coadds of 2.8-second\\nintegration time each. Standard image reduction meth-\\nods were applied, including flat-fielding, sky subtraction,\\nand cosmic ray removal via the Keck AO Imaging (KAI)\\ndata reduction pipeline (Lu et al. 2021).\\nPhotometry was performed on individual images to\\nconstruct light curves for Sgr A*. We used the point\\nspread function (PSF) fitting program Starfinder to\\nmeasure the brightness and position of sources (Diolaiti\\net al. 2000). Using the same procedure as in Do et al.\\n(2019), a different PSF was constructed for each image\\nto account for changes in effective PSF due to seeing\\nvariations. To increase the number of Sgr A* detec-\\ntions at faint flux levels, we used an enhanced version\\nofStarfinder that includes a priori knowledge of the\\nlocation of Sgr A* and other nearby NIR sources (Horn-\\nstein et al. 2007). For each epoch, the source locations\\nin a nightly-averaged image were used as fixed inputs\\ninto Starfinder to more accurately fit for Sgr A* and\\nneighboring sources in the individual frames.\\nOur photometric calibration has been updated since\\nDo et al. (2019), making the observed flux densities of\\nall sources within the central arcsecond of the Galactic\\ncenter (including Sgr A*) systematically lower by ∼10%.\\nPhotometric uncertainties were estimated by fitting a\\npower law between the flux and RMS flux uncertainty\\nfor stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*, as described in Do\\net al. (2009). We then used this relationship to calculate\\nthe uncertainty in flux for Sgr A*. More details about\\nour photometric calibration and uncertainty estimations\\ncan be found in Appendix A. The photometric stability\\nof our observations is discussed in Appendix B.\\nIn this study, we work with observed flux densities\\n(rather than dereddened) to make our results compara-\\nble to Do et al. (2019). We convert our observed K′\\nfluxes to observed Ksfluxes using the filter transforma-\\ntionFKs= 1.09FK′(Do et al. 2019). Dereddened fluxes\\ncan be computed using Fdereddened =Fobs×100.4AKs.\\nDifferent studies have used different extinction values,\\nsuch as AKs= 2.46 (Sch¨ odel et al. 2010), AKs= 2.8\\n(Genzel et al. 2003; Eckart et al. 2006), AKs= 3.2\\n(Hornstein et al. 2007), and AKs= 3.3 (Do et al. 2009).\\nAs in Do et al. (2019), we will occasionally aid readers by\\npresenting both observed and dereddened flux densities\\ncomputed using AKs= 2.46.\\n4\\n2.2. Sample selection\\nWe introduce several selection criteria to make our\\nKeck data set more robust for comparing Sgr A* vari-\\nability over time. Beginning with 104 Galactic center\\nobservation epochs from 2005-2022, we apply the fol-\\nlowing successive cuts to our sample:\\n1. Considering only observing epochs in which 20\\nor more quality (Strehl ratio >0.2) images of the\\nGalactic center were taken. Below 20 frames, the\\nlight curves are poorly sampled for timing analy-\\nses. 18 such epochs are removed from our sample.\\n2. Removing epochs in which our PSF reference stars\\nare saturated. Saturated PSF reference stars in-\\ntroduce a photometric bias that makes our Sgr A*\\nflux measurements unreliable. 3 such epochs are\\nremoved from our sample.3. Removing epochs in which the bright star S0-2 ( K\\n= 14.2 mag) is confused with Sgr A* (in late 2017\\nand 2018). Attempting to correct for S0-2’s flux\\nbias introduces large uncertainties that are compa-\\nrable to faint Sgr A* flux levels. 14 such epochs are\\nremoved, leaving 69 observation epochs for con-\\nsideration.

Significantly different flux distribution in 2019\\n6\\nThe flux distributions of Sgr A* reveal that flux densi-\\nties in 2019 were elevated at both faint and bright levels,\\nand that the post-2019 activity of Sgr A* is statistically\\nconsistent with the pre-2019 activity. We construct his-\\ntograms of the light curves and present the flux distribu-\\ntions for the pre-2019 (2005-2017), 2019, and post-2019\\n(2020-2022) epochs in Figure 1. In our sample, Sgr A*\\nis detected ∼93% of the time. Our treatment of non-\\ndetections is discussed in Appendix E.\\nAs shown in Do et al. (2019), the 2019 distribution\\nhas a tail extending to high flux densities that is not\\npresent before 2019. Our post-2019 results show no such\\nextended tail, indicating that we have seen no high flux\\ndensities at 2019 levels in more recent years. We observe\\nthat the shapes of the pre- and post-2019 distributions\\nappear to be quite similar, whereas the 2019 distribution\\nappears skewed to higher flux densities.\\nWe are also able to measure the long-term median\\nof the flux distribution, enabled by our consistent re-\\nduction methodology with photometric corrections for\\nstellar confusion. We find that the median of the 2019\\ndistribution is 0.20 mJy (1.9 mJy dereddened), which\\ndoubles the 0.10 mJy (1.0 mJy dereddened) medians of\\nthe pre- and post-2019 distributions. Other percentiles\\nof the flux distribution are presented in Table 2. We\\nobserve that in addition to the median, the flux levels of\\n2019 are elevated at all percentiles compared to the pre-\\nceding and succeeding distributions, demonstrating that\\nthe 2019 behavior was indeed unusual beyond merely\\nthe extremely bright event of 2019-05-13. On the other\\nhand, nearly all percentiles are similar between the pre-\\nand post-2019 distributions. The exception is at the\\nhigh flux end, where discrepancies between the pre- and\\npost-2019 distributions are explained by a recent lack of\\nbright flux excursions. Furthermore, by adding our flux\\ndistributions and dividing by the number of observations\\nwithin each time period, we can compare the average lu-\\nminosity of Sgr A* at 2.12 µm. We find that Sgr A* was\\non average ∼3 times more luminous at this wavelength\\nin 2019 than in the pre-2019 observations. Since 2019,\\nSgr A* has had an average luminosity of ∼0.9 times its\\npre-2019 luminosity.\\nWe can use two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests\\nto quantitatively compare our flux distributions. We\\nnote that KS-tests assume independent measurements\\nand Sgr A* light curves are time-correlated on an intra-\\nnight basis; however, as in Do et al. (2019), we can\\ncompare flux distributions with multiple nights of ob-\\nservations that are uncorrelated with one another to\\nroughly compare the general behavior of Sgr A* over\\nlong time periods. We use the inferred flux distributions\\n(described in Appendix E) to mitigate the bias inducedby non-detections. Performing a KS-test between our\\npre-2019 and 2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of\\n0.39 ( p≪1), showing it is highly unlikely that these\\ndata sets come from the same underlying distribution.\\nDo et al. (2019) also used a KS-test and found a large\\ndisagreement between the 2019 sample and historical\\ndata. Performing a KS-test between our 2019 and post-\\n2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of 0.36 ( p≪1),\\nshowing these data sets are also highly unlikely to come\\nfrom the same underlying distribution. On the other\\nhand, performing a KS-test between our pre-2019 and\\npost-2019 distributions yields a much lower KS-statistic\\nof 0.04 ( p∼0.03), showing these distributions are more\\nsimilar. If we restrict our KS-test to flux densities above\\n0.05 mJy (where non-detections become negligible), we\\nfind a comparable KS-statistic of 0.05 ( p∼0.01). Based\\non these results, we find that the pre-2019 and post-2019\\nflux distributions of Sgr A* agree at the ∼2σlevel.\\nFigure 1. Measured flux distributions of Sgr A* scaled to com-\\npare peaks and shapes of the pre-2019 (blue), 2019 (black), and\\npost-2019 (orange) distributions, with dashed lines showing the\\ndistribution medians. We find that the 2019 flux distribution is\\nelevated with respect to the pre- and post-2019 distributions.\\nIn addition to consistency between the pre-2019 and\\npost-2019 flux distributions, we find that the post-2019\\ndata agree with model predictions. As in Do et al.\\n(2019), we compare the observations to the model 3\\nof Witzel et al. (2018), which is a log-normally dis-\\ntributed red noise process. This model was informed\\nby over 13,000 infrared measurements from Keck, VLT,\\nand Spitzer and importantly accounts for the temporal\\ncorrelations of Sgr A*’s flux with time. For each of our\\nthree samples (pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019), we draw\\n10,000 parameter combinations from the posterior and\\nfor each parameter combination, generate a single light\\ncurve with the time sampling of the nights in the respec-\\ntive sample (45 nights for pre-2019, 6 nights for 2019,\\n7\\nTable 2.

In Figure 2, we present a\\ncomparison of the observed data with the median, 1 σ,\\n2σ, and 3 σcredible intervals of the complementary cu-\\nmulative distribution function (CCDF ≡1 - CDF) for\\neach set of 10,000 simulated light curves.\\nConsistent with the expectation that our historical\\nsample should agree with the established model, our\\npre-2019 observations match the historical model at the\\n1-2σlevel. We find that the 2019 bright flux excursions\\nfall outside of the model’s 3 σintervals, as shown in Do\\net al. (2019), but with new observations from late 2019.\\nOf most interest to this study is the behavior of Sgr\\nA* in the years since 2019. We find that the post-2019\\nobservations fall within the predictions of the historical\\nmodel. The lack of high fluxes in more recent years does\\nplace these observations below model predictions at the\\n∼2.5σlevel (for fluxes reaching ∼0.6 mJy, i.e. all the\\ndata except the two brightest events) and at the ∼1.5σ\\nlevel for the highest measured flux densities. While ad-\\nditional observations in coming years may reveal a more\\nstatistically significant lack of activity, our current re-\\nsults demonstrate that the recent observations are con-\\nsistent with historical expectations at the ∼2σlevel. Sgr\\nA* has displayed statistically typical, albeit diminished\\nlevels of activity.\\n3.1.1. Impact of the brightest night on the flux distribution\\nWe examine the impact that the night with the bright-\\nest event (2019-05-13) has on our results by constructing\\nthe 2019 flux distribution without this night. This in-\\nvestigation is motivated by the possibility of 2019 being\\nan otherwise ordinary era with a single rare event that\\nbiases the flux distribution to higher levels. The flux dis-\\ntribution and percentiles with this night removed can be\\nfound in Appendix F. We find that the removal of this\\nnight certainly impacts the high end of the flux distri-\\nbution, but the median of the distribution remains the\\nsame and the peak of the distribution remains shifted to\\nhigher flux levels with respect to the historical distribu-\\ntion. Although the other nights in 2019 individually do\\nFigure 2.

(2018).\\nThese simulations show that while the 2019 data are inconsistent\\nwith model predictions at the >3σlevel, the pre- and post-2019\\nactivity generally agrees with the model at the 1-2 σlevel. We note\\nthat our 2019 data includes additional observations from late 2019\\nthat were not incorporated into the analysis of Do et al. (2019).\\n8\\nnot reach unprecedented levels, together they display a\\nrelative concentration of high flux densities. A KS-test\\nbetween the pre-2019 distribution and the 2019 distribu-\\ntion without the brightest night yields a KS-statistic of\\n0.42 ( p≪1), reinforcing that these data sets are highly\\ndissimilar. As such, we conclude that our finding that\\nthe 2019 flux distribution is significantly different is ro-\\nbust whether or not the brightest night is included. The\\ninclusion of this night only bolsters the result.\\n3.2. Bright events in the NIR Sgr A* light curve\\nThe light curve of Sgr A* over 17 years shows the\\nheightened flux densities in 2019 and relative lack of ac-\\ntivity in the following years (see Figure 3). To construct\\nthis light curve, we stitch together the pre-2019, 2019,\\nand post-2019 data and remove time gaps between ob-\\nservation epochs. Individual light curves from each of\\nthese three subsets displaying both bright and faint flux\\ndensities are shown in Appendix G.\\nWe find no bright fluxes in the post-2019 data at the\\nlevel of the two brightest events in 2019. In six nights of\\n2019 observations, the two brightest events have maxi-\\nmum flux densities of 5.58 ±0.04 mJy (corresponding to\\n53.8 mJy dereddened) and 1.56 ±0.03 mJy (15.0 mJy\\ndereddened). In seven nights of observations in 2020\\nand 2021, the highest flux density measured is only 0.60\\n±0.04 mJy (5.8 mJy dereddened). In 11 observation\\nepochs in 2022, we observed only two bright flux excur-\\nsions with maximum flux densities of 0.74 ±0.06 mJy\\n(7.1 mJy dereddened) and 0.93 ±0.03 mJy (9.0 mJy\\ndereddened). Neither of these are comparable to the\\n2019 events.\\nThere is also a lack of bright flux excursions in the\\npost-2019 data as compared to the pre-2019 data. We\\nobserve four events in the pre-2019 data (counting two\\non 2010-05-05) with flux densities greater than 1 mJy\\nand no flux densities at this level post-2019. Six events\\nwith flux densities greater than 0.8 mJy are observed in\\nthe pre-2019 data, and only one is observed post-2019.\\nThe post-2019 sample is only ∼43% as long as the pre-\\n2019 sample, but there remains a relative absence of\\nbright fluxes in more recent years.\\n3.3. Sgr A* has no quiescent state in the NIR\\nOur new methodology allows for measurements of\\nfaint flux densities in the NIR over 17 years and the abil-\\nity to search for a quiescent, quasi-steady state. Such a\\nstate would present itself as a “floor” to the Sgr A* light\\ncurve. This study is the first to examine faint Sgr A*\\nflux densities from 2005-2022 while making corrections\\nfor stellar confusion, allowing for reliable comparisons of\\nfaint Sgr A* flux densities over a long time baseline to\\nsearch for such a floor.We find that there is no quasi-steady floor to the NIR\\nSgr A* light curve at faint flux densities. When viewed\\nin linear flux space (such as the upper light curve in Fig-\\nure 3), Sgr A* does appear to spend most of its time in\\na faint state that is punctuated by bright “flares”. How-\\never, the data show that Sgr A* has been highly variable\\neven at low flux densities over 17 years. By examining\\nthe light curve in logarithmic flux density space (bottom\\nlight curve in Figure 3), we see that Sgr A* shows no qui-\\nescent state in the NIR and instead displays stochastic\\nvariability over a factor of ∼500 in flux. Flux densities\\ndo not level off at some faint value, but are continuously\\nand significantly variable down to about 0.01 mJy (0.1\\nmJy dereddened), which is the limit where we are able\\nto detect Sgr A* with >1σconfidence and which only a\\nsmall fraction of frames likely fall below.\\n3.4. Timing characteristics of the light curves\\nWe can use the first order structure function to exam-\\nine the timing characteristics of the NIR light curves,\\nas is often done in timing analyses for both Sgr A* and\\nextragalactic AGN (e.g. Simonetti et al. 1985; Hughes\\net al. 1992; Do et al. 2009). The structure function ulti-\\nmately allows one to determine the power spectral den-\\nsity (PSD) slope for a set of unevenly sampled data. For\\na light curve with flux measurements F(t) at times t, the\\nfirst order structure function V(τ) is defined as\\nV(τ)≡ ⟨[F(t+τ)−F(t)]2⟩. (1)\\nWe bin the time lags τand distribute the V(τ) values\\ninto the corresponding bins. Logarithmic binning is used\\nto more evenly distribute data points into bins, as there\\nare many more samples for smaller time lags. The aver-\\nage of V(τ) values within each bin is used as the struc-\\nture function value for that bin. The error associated\\nwith each bin is σbin/√Nbin, where σbinis the standard\\ndeviation of V(τ) values within that bin and Nbinis the\\nnumber of values in the bin. The structure functions\\nfor the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 light curves are\\npresented in Figure 4.\\nThe logarithmic slope of the structure function β\\n(where V(τ)∝τβ) can be related to the power law index\\nαof the PSD ( P∝f−α) for each of the pre-2019, 2019,\\nand post-2019 samples. To make the conversion from\\nmeasured measured βtoα, we generate 103light curves\\nwith the respective time sampling and fixed PSD slope\\nα, then measure the structure function slope β. This\\nprocedure is repeated for varying values of αbetween\\nα= 1.5 and α= 3.0. We perform a linear fit between α\\nandβ(see Appendix I), then use this linear fit to convert\\nthe structure function slopes we measure in the real data\\nto PSD slopes.

The structure function slope\\nβis measured in the regime where the structure function\\nis approximately linear (5-40 minutes) to avoid artifacts\\nfrom three-minute dithering and increased white noise\\nin the observations at short time lags. However, we do\\nfactor a systematic uncertainty into our reported αand\\nβmeasurements computed from the standard deviation\\nof structure function fits in several time intervals (1-40\\nminutes, 3-40 minutes, 5-40 minutes, 1-30 minutes, 3-30\\nminutes, and 5-30 minutes).\\nWe see that the structure functions have PSD slopes of\\nα≈2-3, consistent with previous findings (e.g. Do et al.\\n2009) that Sgr A* displays red-noise, power-law behav-\\nior with higher variability at longer time lags. We find\\na steeper αfor 2019 and a shallower αfor the post-2019\\ndata. However, it is worth noting that a more signifi-\\ncant white noise component from stellar contamination\\nin 2020-2022 could cause us to measure a shallower slope\\nfor these years (see Appendix I).

In 2020-\\n2022, the behavior of Sgr A* was statistically similar,\\nbut slightly diminished compared to that of 2005-2017.\\nWe also find that Sgr A* has no quiescent state over 17\\nyears of NIR observations. These findings have implica-\\ntions for understanding the time-variable accretion flow\\nonto Sgr A*.\\nThe pronounced shift in the 2019 median flux density\\nsuggests that Sgr A* experienced a heightened accretion\\nrate, revealing that the 2019 NIR activity was extraor-\\ndinary beyond just the bright events. Gravity Collabo-\\nration et al. (2020) also reported an elevated median in\\n2019 (compared to the years 2017 and 2018), although\\nit was found not statistically significant given the num-\\nber of observations over a time baseline of 3 years. Our\\ntime baseline of 17 years provides stronger evidence for\\na shift in the median of the flux distribution in 2019.\\nThe two-state model for the flux distribution with a log-\\nnormal quiescent state and power-law tail (Dodds-Eden\\net al. 2011; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020) interprets\\nbright flares as manifestations of such a tail, but does\\nnot account for the changes to the faint emission that we\\nobserve in 2019 in this study. Because we see elevated\\nactivity at both low and high levels in 2019, explana-\\ntions invoking a physical change to Sgr A*’s accretion\\nstate are favored over a new statistical model.\\nMulti-wavelength observations of Sgr A* in 2019 also\\nfavor a physical change to the accretion flow. The tem-\\nporal concentration of high fluxes observed in 2019 by\\nKeck and VLT in the NIR, as well as heightened activ-\\nity in radio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al.\\n2022; Cheng et al. 2023) and X-rays (e.g. Pavlinsky 2019;\\nDegenaar et al. 2019) is also evidence for a physical dis-\\nturbance during 2019. If Sgr A*’s variability were bet-\\nter characterized by a different underlying distribution\\nthan that of Witzel et al. (2018) (a single stochastic pro-\\ncess with a log-normal distribution), we would expect tosee bright events and elevated multi-wavelength activity\\nmore evenly distributed over two decades, rather than\\nclustered together in a single year.\\nOur results favor models in which extra gas was de-\\nposited onto the black hole in 2019, temporarily increas-\\ning the accretion rate and stimulating the production of\\nfrequent bright events. Such models include a distur-\\nbance induced by the closest approach of the star S0-2\\nin 2018 or the delayed infall of gas pulled from a tidal in-\\nteraction with the dusty object G2 in 2014. Kawashima\\net al. (2017) predicted a time-delayed radio and infrared\\nbrightening of Sgr A* around 2020 caused by the pas-\\nsage of G2. In their simulations, the magnetic energy\\nwithin the accretion disk increases by a factor of 3-4 af-\\nter∼5 years following the passage of G2. Murchikova\\n(2021) calculates that the infall time of material from G2\\n(and the possible simultaneous infall of material from\\nthe object G1) more closely matches the time delay be-\\ntween pericenter passage and flaring time than that of\\nS0-2. Hydrodynamic simulations have also shown that\\nwinds from the passage of S0-2 are unlikely to have a\\nmeasurable effect on the inner accretion flow (Ressler\\net al. 2018). If the 2019 activity was indeed caused by a\\ntemporary accretion increase, these findings collectively\\nfavor the G2 hypothesis over the S0-2 hypothesis as a\\nsource for the excess material.\\nWe rule out a long-term elevated accretion state, as\\nthe variability of Sgr A* resembles its past activity and\\nno extraordinarily bright events have been observed in\\nmore recent years. In fact, we have noted a slight\\nlowering of the post-2019 flux distribution at the high\\nend, although this effect is not statistically significant.\\nNumerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical\\n(GRMHD) simulations have revealed that bright flares\\npowered by magnetic reconnection can eject part of the\\naccretion disk and suppress the mass accretion rate onto\\nthe black hole (Ripperda et al. 2022). Changes to the\\nmagnetic flux content of the disk in simulations have\\nmeasurable effects on the light curves and flux distri-\\nbutions of Sgr A* (Chatterjee et al. 2021). The lack\\nof high flux densities post-2019 and the slight decrease\\nin mean luminosity could imply that the 2019 activity\\naltered the accretion flow onto Sgr A* for an extended\\nperiod of time. With more observations, we will be able\\n11\\nto determine whether the relative inactivity of Sgr A*\\nin more recent years is in fact statistically significant.\\nA major challenge to precision measurement of the\\nflux distribution of Sgr A* is stellar confusion. Recent\\nobservations with NIR interferometry (e.g. Gravity Col-\\nlaboration et al. 2020) have improved angular resolution\\nand reduced the impact of confusion on flux measure-\\nments, but such observations of Sgr A* have only be-\\ngun in 2017. Single-telescope data is complementary to\\ninterferometric data because it offers a long time base-\\nline to compare the behavior of Sgr A* across decades,\\nbut as in this work, care must be taken to account for\\nconfusion. Future work to combine single-telescope and\\ninterferometric data sets would help reduce systematics\\nin the study of Sgr A* variability.\\n5.CONCLUSION\\nEach hypothesis for the 2019 activity of Sgr A* is\\nscientifically plausible for understanding the activity in\\nterms of an excess accretion flow onto the black hole.\\nIf we are able to trace the activity to S0-2 or G2, we\\nwill directly connect the supermassive black hole’s feed-\\ning behavior to an object in its vicinity and learn more\\nabout how neighboring objects supply material for the\\nblack hole to accrete. If Sgr A* has undergone a change\\nof state, we will catch a real-time glimpse into the phys-\\nical response of a supermassive black hole accretion flow\\nto an increase in gas flow. In any case, it is important to\\ndetermine whether the 2019 activity is representative of\\nSgr A*’s typical behavior or a period of extraordinary\\nactivity. If the former, the 2019 activity should be in-\\ncluded in long-term models of Sgr A*. If the latter, the\\nunusual behavior should be treated as a separate period\\nwith distinct physical characteristics.\\nTo investigate the origin of the 2019 activity, we have\\ndone the following:\\n•Performed a consistent reduction of Keck Sgr A*\\nobservations from 2005-2022 with new treatment\\nfor stellar confusion to enable a robust comparison\\nof flux densities over nearly two decades\\n•Demonstrated that both faint and bright 2019 flux\\ndensities were significantly elevated with respect\\nto pre- and post-2019 observations\\n•Shown that the average luminosity of Sgr A* was\\n∼3 times higher than historical measurements in\\n2019 and ∼0.9 times historical measurements in\\nthe years 2020-2022\\n•Shown that while the post-2019 observations are\\nstatistically consistent with the historical sample,\\nas well as with the statistical model of Witzel et al.(2018), we have observed a relative deficiency in\\nactivity in 2020-2022 at the ∼2σlevel\\n•Demonstrated that 2019 showed heightened vari-\\nability with respect to the years before and after,\\nindicating that a greater average luminosity seems\\ncorrelated with more extreme variability\\n•Found no evidence for a NIR quiescent state of Sgr\\nA*; Sgr A* displays stochastic flux variations over\\na factor of ∼500 and is continuously variable down\\nto about 0.01 mJy\\nWe argue that the observed increase in NIR flux den-\\nsities in 2019, along with the concentration of bright\\nevents measured by many observatories that year, points\\nto a transient increase in accretion activity during 2019.\\nIn these models, excess gas is temporarily deposited onto\\nthe black hole from the closest approach of a nearby ob-\\nject, raising the median flux and increasing the probabil-\\nity of bright events. Numerical simulations and analytic\\ncalculations have favored the black hole’s tidal interac-\\ntion with G2 in 2014 as a source for this excess material.\\nFurther modeling of G-object interactions with the ac-\\ncretion flow and their ability to cause the 2019 activity\\nshould be done to provide a more robust comparison to\\nobservations.\\nWe have ruled out the hypothesis that 2019 is a pre-\\ncursor to a long-term elevated accretion state, as the\\ncurrent behavior of Sgr A* resembles its behavior be-\\nfore 2019, and we have seen a lack of high fluxes in more\\nrecent years. Future NIR observations will continue to\\nmonitor the black hole for signs of increased (or de-\\ncreased) activity. Further analyses of multi-wavelength\\ndata will help us compare the physical mechanisms be-\\nhind the bright events of 2019 and other years.\\nWe thank the anonymous referee for their helpful com-\\nments.

(2019) and Gautam et al.\\n(2019). The magnitude difference between the previous and new photometric calibrations for sources in the central 10\\narcseconds is 0 .093±0.003 and in the central 1 arsecond in 0 .096±0.003, with stars being systematically fainter in the\\nnew calibration (see Figure 5). In this work, we used the following calibrator stars: IRS 16NW, S3-22, S1-17, S1-34,\\nS4-3, S1-1, S1-21, S3-370, S3-88, S3-36, and S2-63. We derived reference flux measurements for the selected calibrator\\nstars using the Sch¨ odel et al. (2010) photometric catalog transformed to the Keck NIRC2 bandpasses. The procedure\\nto transform fluxes from VLT NACO KsandH-bands to Keck NIRC2 K′andH-bands is described in more detail in\\nGautam et al. (2019). More details of our new photometric calibration are forthcoming in Gautam et al. in prep.\\nPhotometric uncertainties were estimated by fitting a power law between the flux level and RMS flux uncertainty\\nfor stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*, as described in Do et al. (2009). We then used this relationship to calculate\\nthe uncertainty in flux measurements for Sgr A*. The photometric uncertainties are generally less than 15% for\\nlow flux values ( ≲0.2 mJy) and less than 5% for high flux values ( ≳0.2 mJy). Sample power law fits to determine\\nflux measurement uncertainties are shown in Figure 6. The flux uncertainties for central arcsecond sources are not\\nsignificantly different between the previous and new photometric calibrations.\\nFigure 5. Comparison of observed magnitudes for Galactic center sources between the photometric calibration of Do et al. (2019) and\\nthe new calibration in this work (Gautam et al. in prep.), as a function of magnitude in the new calibration. We see that sources are\\nsystematically fainter by about 10% with the new calibration.\\nB.PHOTOMETRIC STABILITY\\nWe investigate the photometric stability of our observations by constructing flux distributions for two comparison\\nstars, S1-1 and S1-33, that are known to not be variable and span nearly an order of magnitude in flux (Gautam et al. in\\nprep). The pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 flux distributions of these stars and the nightly mean and standard deviation\\nof the fluxes are presented in Figure 7. We find that the differences between the means and standard deviations of the\\nflux distributions of these stars is not significant between the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 eras. The total 2005-2022\\nflux distribution for S1-1 can be described by a Gaussian with a width of ∼3%, and that of S1-33 can be described by\\na Gaussian with a width of ∼5%. The scatter of mean flux levels between individual nights for S1-1 is ∼2% and for\\nS1-33 is ∼4%. Within individual nights, the average scatter is ∼1% for S1-1 and ∼3% for S1-33. As such, between\\nall of our observations we are able to consistently reproduce the fluxes of S1-1 and S1-33 at the level of a few percent.\\nThe fluctuations in flux density for these non-variable stars are much smaller than the variations in Sgr A* flux density\\nthat we find, indicating that the shifts in the Sgr A* flux distributions that we report are photometrically robust.\\nC.OBSERVATION EPOCHS OMITTED\\nIn Section 2.2, we describe the successive cuts made to our sample to ensure robust photometry and comparisons of\\nSgr A* activity over time. Out of the 104 Galactic center K′observing epochs taken with Keck from 2005-2022, the\\n35 that we have omitted from our analysis are given in Table 4, along with the reasons for omission.\\n15\\nFigure 6. Sample power law fits to the RMS fluxes for stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A* within the typical Sgr A* flux range. Shown\\nhere are the fits for three observing epochs (2010-05-05, 2019-05-13, 2022-05-21). We perform this procedure for each of the 69 nights in\\nour sample and use the respective power law fits to determine the uncertainties on the Sgr A* flux measurements.\\nFigure 7.

The Table 5 data are presented as observed in the K′-band without corrections\\nfor extinction and before applying the photometric corrections for stellar confusion given in Table 9.\\nE.NON-DETECTIONS OF SGR A*\\nIn the data, Sgr A* is detected ∼93% of the time, indicating that the flux distribution is mostly unbiased. However,\\nbecause the flux of Sgr A* does not vary significantly between consecutive frames, we can estimate the values of\\nnon-detected fluxes based on the lowest neighboring flux measurement in the light curves. Comparisons between the\\nmeasured and inferred flux distributions are shown in Figure 8. We find that Sgr A* is detected >99% of the time\\nabove FKs= 0.05 mJy. ∼26% of frames in the pre-2019 distribution, ∼12% of frames in the 2019 distribution, and\\n17\\nTable 5.

Missing flux and magnitude values in the full\\ntable correspond to non-detections of Sgr A*.\\n∼24% of frames in the post-2019 distribution fall below this threshold. As such, while we estimate flux distribution\\npercentiles using the inferred flux distributions, the median (50th percentile) values we present are not biased by the\\nnon-detections.

The values of\\nnon-detections in the inferred distributions are estimated from neighboring flux measurements in the light curves.\\nF.2019 FLUX DISTRIBUTION WITH BRIGHTEST NIGHT REMOVED\\nIn Section 3.1.1, we discuss how removing the night with the highest flux densities (2019-05-13) impacts our analysis\\nof the flux distribution. Figure 9 shows the 2019 flux distribution without the brightest night, and Table 6 shows the\\npercentiles of the flux distribution.\\nG.INDIVIDUAL LIGHT CURVES\\nWe present some individual light curves from pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 observing epochs to demonstrate the\\nrange of variability that Sgr A* exhibits. Figure 10 shows some of the brightest measured flux densities and Figure 11\\ncontains light curves displaying relatively low activity.\\nH.STELLAR CONFUSION CORRECTION\\nThe Galactic center is a crowded field with stars occasionally confusing Sgr A* on the sky, so we must consider how\\nextended PSFs from nearby stellar sources contaminate the measured Sgr A* flux. Previous studies (e.g. Witzel et al.\\n18\\nFigure 9. Flux distributions of Sgr A* scaled to compare peaks and shapes of the pre-2019 distribution (blue), 2019 distribution (black),\\nand 2019 distribution with the brightest night removed (gold), with dashed lines showing the distribution medians. Although removing\\nthe brightest night lowers the high flux end of the 2019 distribution, the peak of the 2019 distribution remains elevated with respect to the\\nhistorical distribution, and the 2019 median is unchanged.\\nTable 6.

This procedure makes all the\\ndata comparable, but deletes information about potential shifts in the median flux density caused by changes in the\\naccretion rate. In this study, we seek to measure the shift in the median of the flux distribution between 2019 and\\nother years to examine the accretion flow, so we take a new approach to characterizing confusion.\\nTo correct for the flux bias attributed to Sgr A* for epochs when a known star is within the confusion limit, we\\nsubtract a value informed from simulations of stellar confusion with Sgr A*. We injected synthetic stars near Sgr A* in\\na series of five unconfused images from 2014-05-19 with characteristic data quality (Strehl ratio ∼0.27) and median Sgr\\nA* flux levels ( ∼0.1 mJy), noting that our results are relatively insensitive to these choices within the uncertainties. In\\neach set of images, we planted stars at distances from 0-100 mas (randomly oriented) and K′brightnesses from 14-18\\nmag, then ran Starfinder on the simulated images. See Figure 12 for sample images from our injection procedure. By\\nsubtracting out the known unconfused flux of Sgr A* from our detected value, we are able to obtain an estimate for\\nthe photometric bias induced by the stellar injections. The results of this procedure can be found in Table 7. We also\\nmeasure the position of Sgr A* and report the astrometric biases in Table 8. For injections below 60 mas, the source\\nand Sgr A* are almost always detected as a combined source, making the confusion correction reliable. However, from\\n∼60-80 mas, Sgr A* and the injected star are sometimes detected together, individually, or not at all–with varying flux\\ndensities in each case. While no confusion corrections for 60-80 mas were needed in this study, future studies should\\ntreat this range with care by determining whether Starfinder is detecting Sgr A* and the confused star separately\\nor together. Beyond 80 mas, Sgr A* is unambiguously detected with photometric biases consistent with zero, so no\\ncorrections are needed for stars at these distances.\\nFor the observation epochs affected by stellar confusion, we determined the distance of the confusing star from Sgr\\nA* by performing an orbital fit to aligned images of the Galactic center and obtaining the predicted distance at the\\n19\\nFigure 10.\\nSample observed Kslight curves of Sgr A* displaying bright flux excursions.

Given the brightness of the star and its distance, we interpolated\\nthe star-planting results in Table 7 to obtain the flux bias to subtract from the data. The epoch-wise corrections we\\napplied are given in Table 9, and the flux distributions of affected data before and after correction are shown in Figure\\n13. This procedure overcorrects and yields negative flux values in only a small percentage of frames. The corrections\\nslightly increase the photometric uncertainties to ∼20% for low fluxes, and high flux uncertainties are typically less\\nthan 5%. In this work, we have excluded epochs in which the bright star S0-2 falls within 60 mas of Sgr A* (July\\n2017-2018), as the uncertainties on S0-2’s flux bias correction are comparable to faint Sgr A* flux levels. Starfinder\\nreliably detects S0-2 and Sgr A* as distinct sources in the remaining data.\\nThere is likely an unresolved stellar component that contributes to the measured flux densities, but we are unable\\nto disentangle this effect from temporal variations of the Sgr A* baseline flux in this study. However, these unresolved\\nstars are faint by nature and expected to only slightly shift the median flux density between epochs.\\nI.STRUCTURE FUNCTION ANALYSIS\\nTo convert between the structure function slope βand PSD slope α, we generate 103light curves with the respective\\ntime sampling and fixed PSD slope α, then measure the structure function slope β. This procedure is repeated for\\n20\\nFigure 11.\\nSample of faint Kslight curves of Sgr A*. Dashed lines show the 95th and 50th percentile flux values from the historical\\ndistribution.

See Figure 14 for the relationships between αandβthat we find from the simulations. We perform\\na linear fit to these values to make the conversion between structure function slope and PSD slope in the data.\\nIn Table 3, we found a shallower PSD slope for the 2020-2022 data compared to the pre-2019 and 2019 data. To\\ndetermine whether a greater white noise component in the post-2019 data is responsible for this shallower slope, we\\nsimulate 103light curves with the post-2019 time sampling assuming an intrisic PSD slope of α= 2.5, then add varying\\nlevels of white noise and fit for a measured value of α(a procedure performed in Do et al. 2019). We find in Figure\\n15 that as the ratio of white noise to red noise becomes ≲10, a flatter PSD slope is indeed measured. As a result, the\\nwhite noise contamination from the stars S0-61 in 2021 and S0-38 in 2022 could have caused a shallower value of αto\\nbe measured for these years.\\n21\\nFigure 12.\\nSample images from our star injection routine. The upper left image shows the central 0.5” ×0.5” of a Galactic center frame\\nfrom 2014-05-19 with no artificial star injected. This frame was chosen for its typical data quality (Strehl ratio ∼0.27), typical\\nSgr A* brightness of K= 16.8 mag, and Sgr A* being relatively unconfused by known stars. In the remaining images above,\\naK= 16.5 mag star is injected into the images with respective distances from Sgr A* labeled and random orientations. We\\nthen ran our PSF fitting program Starfinder on each image to determine the photometric bias in our measurement of Sgr A*’s\\nflux. This procedure was repeated for five similar frames and the average values of the photometric bias induced by the injected\\nstars are displayed at the bottom of each image. As a general trend, the photometric bias decreases with increasing distance.\\nWe repeated this procedure for injected star brightnesses ranging from K= 14−18 mag.\\n22\\nTable 7.

The current highest redshift quasar host\\ndetected3, atz=4.5, required the magnifying effect of a foreground lensing galaxy. Low-luminosity\\nquasars4,5,6from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)7mitigate the\\nchallenge of detecting their underlying, previously-undetected host galaxies. Here we report rest-\\nframe optical images and spectroscopy of two HSC-SSP quasars at z>6with JWST . Using NIRCam\\nimaging at 3.6 µm and 1.5 µm and subtracting the light from the unresolved quasars, we find that\\nthe host galaxies are massive (stellar masses of 13×and3.4×1010M⊙, respectively), compact, and\\ndisk-like. NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy shows stellar absorption lines in the more\\nmassive quasar, confirming the detection of the host. Velocity-broadened gas in the vicinity of these\\nquasars enables measurements of their black hole masses ( 1.4×109and2.0×108M⊙, respectively).\\nTheir location in the black hole mass - stellar mass plane is consistent with the distribution at low\\nredshift, suggesting that the relation between black holes and their host galaxies was already in\\nplace less than a billion years after the Big Bang.\\nThe quasars J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 (coordinates listed in Extended Data Table 1) are at redshifts\\nof6.40and6.34. They have relatively low luminosity ( M1450=−23.87and−23.66mag, respectively),\\nroughly 10 times less luminous than typical bright quasars at these redshifts8,9,10. Using JWST with\\nNIRCam11, we observed J2236+0032 on November 6, 2022 and J2255+0251 on October 26, 2022. Images\\nwere taken in two broad-band filters (F356W and F150W) to detect their host galaxies at 3.56 and 1.50 µm,\\nthus bracketing the rest-frame 4000 Å break, a characteristic feature of galaxy spectra which constrains\\nthe age of the stellar population. Total exposure times were approximately 3,100 seconds for each filter\\nper target.\\nIn Figure 1, we show a 24′′×24′′region and zoomed-in cutouts of the JWST images centered on\\nthe quasars for both filters. As expected, both quasars are detected at high significance. The first\\nquasar J2236+0032 ( mF356W =21.75±0.02mag, mF150W =22.78±0.02,) has no evidence of close\\nneighbors. The second quasar J2255+0251 ( mF356W =22.20±0.02mag, mF150W =23.03±0.02) has\\n2\\ntwo neighboring sources ( <2.6′′) that do not have spectroscopic redshifts at this point; however, their\\ndetection in the HSC r- and i-bands suggests that both of them are at lower redshift than the central quasar.\\nThe detection of an underlying host galaxy requires careful decomposition of the two-dimensional\\nlight distribution to separate the unresolved quasar from its host galaxy. We perform a two-component\\nmodel fit of the rest-frame optical emission in a region of the NIRCam images centered on each target.\\nWe use the software galight12to identify stars from each image to model the two-dimensional (2D)\\npoint-spread function (PSF). We then model each quasar image in each filter as a sum of a point-like quasar\\nand an extended host. The host galaxy was modeled using a 2D Sérsic profile13whose parameters include\\nthe position, size (R eff), axis ratio, orientation, flux, and the radial profile/shape of the light distribution\\n(i.e., Sérsic index), allowing a flexible description of the a priori unknown host galaxy shape. In Extended\\nData Table 1, we report the best-fit parameters and their uncertainties based on the dispersion resulting\\nfrom different PSF models with different modeling techniques (see Methods).\\nAs shown in Figure 2, we detect the host galaxies for both targets, which are visible after subtracting\\nthe quasar point-source model (third column). For J2236+0032, the quasar host is significantly detected\\nin both filters ( mF356W =23.12±0.20mag; mF150W =25.12±0.29mag). The inferred host-to-total flux\\nratios are 25.5±4.4%, and 10.2±2.8%with sizes (R eff) of0.7±0.1kpc and 0.5±0.2kpc for F356W\\nand F150W, respectively. The light distribution is elongated in the same direction (i.e., NE–SW) in the\\ntwo filters, suggesting a mildly inclined disk-like host. For this target, we fix the Sérsic index to 1in both\\nbands – corresponding to an exponential disk model – to avoid non-physical fits; this is supported by a\\nsubsequent fit to the host galaxy emission after subtracting the quasar (see Methods). For J2255+0251,\\nthe host galaxy is clearly detected in the F356W band ( mF356W =24.58±0.30mag) with a host-to-total\\nflux ratio of 9.8±2.6%. The host emission extends southeast (left) of the quasar’s location. The size of\\nthe host is inferred to be R eff=1.5±1.1kpc with a Sérsic index of 1.5±1.4, suggesting a more disk-like\\nthan spheroidal profile. The host galaxy is not detected in the F150W image, resulting in an upper limit\\nofmF150W=26.3mag (see Methods). This upper limit provides an important constraint on the galaxy\\nspectral energy distribution (SED). A non-detection is not surprising, given the low host-to-total flux ratio\\nin the F356W band and the fact that galaxies are typically fainter blueward of the 4000 Å break. We\\nuse NIRSpec14observations to demonstrate that the contribution of extended line emission to the host\\nphotometry in F356W is minimal (See Methods).\\nOur two photometric bands lie on either side of the 4000 Å break, allowing us to quantify the\\ncontributions of young and relatively old stars, and thus to estimate the stellar masses of the two quasar\\nhost galaxies. We fit the SED of each host with a single stellar population, in which the stellar metallicity\\nlogZ/Z⊙is constrained to the range [−1,−0.3], the stellar age is within the range [0.01,0.84]Gyr (capped\\nby the age of the universe at redshift 6.4), and the extinction A vis in the range of [0,5.0]mag. With\\nstandard assumptions on the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF), we find that J2236+0032 has a stellar mass\\nof1.3+2.0\\n−0.6×1011M⊙, while J2255+0251 is less massive with 3.4+7.6\\n−1.9×1010M⊙. We use simulations and\\nthree different SED fitting codes to demonstrate that the results are robust, although further observations\\nwill lessen potential systematic errors in these mass estimates (see Methods for full details on our mass\\nestimates and their uncertainties). Our host galaxies are among the highest stellar mass galaxies known at\\nz∼6 (ref. 15).\\nA rest-frame optical spectrum of each quasar was obtained by the NIRSpec instrument on JWST\\n(Figure 3). These spectra cover 2.87–5.27 µm, or approximately 4000–7000 Å in the rest-frame, revealing\\nstrong emission lines including the H β+[O III] multiplet, H α, and blended Fe IIpseudo-continuum. The\\n0.′′2-wide slit was fortuitously aligned along the major axis of the host galaxy of J2236+0032 (Figure 2).\\nRemarkably, we serendipitously identify stellar absorption lines (H γ, Hδ, and H ε) in J2236+0032. Thus\\nthe contribution of stellar light is confirmed both from the imaging and spectroscopy in this object. We\\n3/27\\nuse the velocity width of the broad H βemission line and the rest-frame 5100 Å continuum luminosity to\\nestimate the mass of the central black hole, under the assumption that the high-velocity gas is governed\\nby the gravity of the SMBH. Using a recipe calibrated in the local universe16and subtracting the stellar\\nemission, we obtain virial masses of M BH=1.4×109M⊙for J2236+0032, and M BH=2.0×108M⊙for\\nJ2255+0251, respectively (see Methods).\\nFigure 4 shows the two z∼6.4quasars in the black hole mass – stellar mass plane (left panel), as\\nwell as the inferred underlying relation compared to the local relation (right panel). As is observed in the\\nlocal universe, the quasar hosting the more massive black hole is hosted by the more massive galaxy. To\\nevaluate their location in the M BH– M∗plane relative to the local mass relation, we carry out a simulation,\\nfollowing ref. 17, that takes into account the selection effects for these two quasars in the HSC survey.\\nFor this purpose, we combine the quasar flux limits, the estimated BH mass and accretion rate functions\\natz∼6, as well as uncertainty in our stellar mass estimates to predict the expected M BHfor these two\\nquasars – under the baseline assumption that the M BH–M∗relation does not evolve between z=6.4and\\nthe present. In the left panel, the orange contours show the resulting bivariate probability distribution for\\nthe location of these two quasars, with the measured values overplotted in red. Our two z>6quasars\\nfall within the probability distribution (orange contours) of this simulated z∼6.4sample and are thus\\nconsistent with no evolution of the M BH–M∗relation from z∼6.4toz=0, as shown for the inferred\\nunderlying relation in the right panel of Figure 4. With just two quasars, the probability distribution of the\\nnominal evolution strength is broad as suggested by the width of these uncertainties (see also Extended\\nData Figure 6 in the Methods). However, ongoing JWST observations will give us a significantly larger\\nsample, allowing us to better constrain models for the mutual evolution of the black hole and stellar\\npopulations in galaxies18,19,20.\\nReferences\\n1.Mechtley, M. et al.

Milky Way\\ndust extinction is negligible at the near-infrared wavelengths of interest and is not corrected for.\\nTarget selection\\nThe two objects presented here are part of our Cycle 1 JWST program (Observation ID 1967; PI: M.Onoue)\\nwhich targets 12 of the lowest-luminosity quasars at redshift 6.0 to 6.4 (ref. 23) discovered by the Hyper\\nSuprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program7, an optical wide-field survey using the 8.2-meter Subaru tele-\\nscope. These quasars were spectroscopically confirmed by ground-based follow-up observations4,5,6. The\\nquasars exhibit broad Ly αemission and strong intergalactic medium absorption blueward of Ly α. This\\ndeep survey, which is sensitive to quasars a factor of 10 less luminous than those discovered by shallower\\nsurveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (see Extended Data Figure 1).\\nNIRCam Observations and data reduction\\nThe data presented in this paper were taken with Module B of the NIRCam instrument, which has a field\\nof view of 2.2×2.2square arcminutes. Total exposures of 3,100 seconds in the two filters (F356W and\\nF150W) were obtained simultaneously. A 4×4primary and sub-pixel dithering pattern was employed\\nto mitigate cosmic ray hits and bad pixels in the detector and to ensure sub-pixel resampling during the\\nstacking step. We used the INTRAMODULEBOX andSTANDARD dithering patterns for the primary\\nand sub-pixel dithers, respectively. We used the BRIGHT1 readout mode.\\nThe data were processed using the standard procedures in JWST pipeline version 1.7.2. The pre-\\ncalibrated “Stage 2” image frames were downloaded from the MAST archive. These images have\\nthe pipeline parameter reference files jwst_1009.pmap for J2255+0251 and jwst_1011.pmap for\\nJ2236+0032, as registered in the JWST Calibration Reference Data System1. For individual frames, global\\nbackground light was first subtracted using the Background2D function of Photutils24. The archived\\nimages clearly have horizontal and vertical stripe noise patterns, known as “ 1/fnoise”. This 1/fnoise was\\nsubtracted by first masking bright objects, then collapsing the 2D images along each axis of the detectors\\nand estimating the noise amplitudes by measuring sigma-clipped median values. These amplitudes were\\nthen subtracted from each row and column. The horizontal stripes were measured for each of the four\\ndetector amplifiers separately. These post-processed Stage 2 image frames were then aligned and stacked\\nwith inverse-variance weighting using the Stage 3 pipeline, keeping the original position angle of the\\ndetector for the purpose of building the PSF library. Both F356W and F150W images were resampled with\\na pixel scale a factor of two smaller than that of the detector, using the drizzling algorithm implemented in\\ntheResample step of the pipeline. The final pixel scales for F356W and F150W are 0.′′0315 and0.′′0153 ,\\nrespectively.\\n2D image decomposition of quasar and host galaxy emission using galight\\nAccurate decomposition of the image of a quasar into a central point source and an extended host galaxy\\nrequires a high-quality model for the PSF based on stars detected in the same image as the quasars.\\nSpace-based telescopes have a much sharper and more stable PSF than ground-based telescopes, and\\ntheHubble Space Telescope (HST) has been used to measure quasar host galaxies to redshift up to z∼2\\n(ref. 12,25,26,27). However, HST’s∼90-minute orbit means that it is continually passing between Earth’s\\n1https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu\\n10/27\\nshadow and direct sunlight, causing the telescope to expand and contract (“orbital breathing”) and giving\\nrise to a time-dependent PSF. The difficulty of modeling the PSF has not allowed quasar host galaxies to\\nbe detected significantly beyond z≳3(ref. 1,2,28,29), where host starlight can be only measured through\\nthe SED fitting method30.\\nHere, we follow our tested strategy12, including the analysis of JWST images32, and build a PSF\\nlibrary by identifying all isolated, unsaturated stars of sufficient signal-to noise ratio (SNR) in our\\nimages. We identified 12 |16 PSF stars in filter F150W |F356W for J2236+0032 and 9 |5 PSF stars in\\nfilter F150W |F356W in the images for J2255+0251. We use our two-dimensional modeling software\\ngalight12to fit the quasar images with a model of a scaled PSF (the spatially unresolved point-like\\nquasar) and a PSF-convolved 2D Sérsic profile (the host galaxy). galight is apython -based open-\\nsource package2that utilizes the image modeling capabilities of lenstronomy31. It has been adopted\\nfor quasar decomposition of images by HST12,JWST32, and the HSC survey33. We adopt uniform priors\\nfor the effective radius R eff∈[0.′′03,2.′′0]and the Sérsic index ( n)∈[0.3,9]of the host to avoid unphysical\\nparameter inference. For J2255+0251, there is one nearby object which we fit simultaneously with a Sérsic\\nprofile, allowing us to correct for its effect on the host galaxy properties.\\nWe obtain a weighted inference for the decomposition result as briefly described here. After subtracting\\nthe remaining local background, we use each PSF in our library in turn to fit the image. The performance\\nof each PSF is determined by its best-fit χ2value. We select groups of two, three, and five PSFs from the\\nlibrary that have the top level χ2performance and then average them using psfr (Birrer et al. in prep).\\nTo optimize our modeling of the unresolved quasar emission, we consider both best-fit models using\\nindividual stars and average models based on the combined PSF stars described above. Thus, we add the\\nthree averaged PSFs as new members to the PSF library. We take the results from the five top-performing\\nPSF models in the updated library. We determine our final result parameters by weighting their χ2values,\\nas defined by ref. 12, Eq. (3)-(6). The uncertainties we quote are based on the dispersion in the host\\nproperties from these five different PSF models. Errors based on variation in the PSF models are often\\nsignificantly larger than the formal fitting errors, as has been recently demonstrated using simulations and\\nobservations of quasars and their host galaxies34. The final inferred host filter magnitude, size, Sérsic\\nindex, and other fit parameters are presented in Extended Data Table 1. The images in Figure 2 are based\\non the PSF with the best performance. The sizes of our host galaxies are defined using the Sérsic effective\\nradius R effalong the semi-major axis measured by galight .\\nThe quasar host of J2236+0032 appears to be a compact galaxy. As a result, we find that the Sérsic n\\nis poorly constrained, and the resulting host residual is point-like with an inferred R effof0.′′03(the lower\\nlimit of the prior), indicating that the central PSF has not been fully removed. This model implies a stellar\\nmass with an implausibly high value above 1011.8M⊙given the SED fitting described below. Thus, we\\nrefit this object, fixing n=1in both F356W and F150W. This gives a much-improved model. The host is\\nquite elongated in F356W, suggesting that it is a disky edge-on galaxy. We also find a consistent position\\nangle between F356W and F150W, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, for J2236+0032, we adopt the results with\\nSérsic nfixed to 1. We further directly fit the “data −quasar\" residual image (i.e., host) with the Sérsic\\nmodel and allow the Sérsic index to vary. When we do so, the inferred nis 1.55 with values of R effand the\\nhost magnitude consistent with those with the n=1 fit.\\nSince J2255+0251 has no clear host detection in the F150W band, we re-model the data and fix the\\nhost galaxy parameters (host Sérsic index, R eff, ellipticity, and position angle) to the values inferred from\\nthe F356W band, while allowing the central position and amplitude to vary. We still see no evidence for a\\nhost residual, but the model gives a formal host magnitude of 26.3±0.2mag. We quote these inferences\\n2https://galight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n11/27\\nin Extended Data Table 1 and adopt a lower limit to the magnitude of 26 .3 mag.\\nConfirmation of our 2D decomposition using galfit\\nIn the fitting routine described above, the results are sensitive to the setting of certain parameters. For\\ninstance, a sub-pixel shift of the PSF is typically needed to optimally align with the position of the quasar.\\nThis interpolation within a pixel can result in modest variations in the allocation of flux between the\\nquasar and its host galaxy. In galight , the parameter point_source_supersampling_factor\\ncontrols this interpolation. For guidance here on the optimal setting, we compared our results with the\\ndecomposition from galfit35while implementing different supersampling factor values, i.e., 1 (no\\ninterpolation) and 2. The choice of supersampling factor had a greater impact on the F150W decomposi-\\ntion than that on the F356W image. We found that the two codes are in close agreement when using a\\nsupersampling_factor of 2 as shown in Extended Data Figure 2 and reported in Extended Data\\nTable 1. As a result, to account for the uncertainty associated with this setting, we report the averaged\\nresults obtained using both supersampling_factor values of 1 and 2, with uncertainties covered by\\nthese two settings.\\nTests of the robustness of the host galaxy properties\\nWe perform several sanity checks for our two quasars to confirm that the detections of their host galaxies\\nare real. First, our final reduced data are co-added using 16 dithers. To check whether the apparent host is\\ncaused by a random ghost from any particular dither frame, we reanalyze the data using the first 8 and the\\nsecond 8 dithers separately. We are able to detect the host from both halves of the data. To ensure that the\\napparent host galaxy flux is not dominated by a mismatched PSF core, we mask the quasar center (using a\\n0.′′12and0.′′06radius aperture for F356W and F150W, respectively) and redo the fit. Again, the host is\\nwell-detected.\\nTo rule out the possibility that the residual emission (host galaxy) is an artifact of the chosen PSF stars,\\nwe selected the five top-performing PSF in the library, and identified twenty pairs from these. We then fit\\none PSF with the other without assuming any host component for all pairs. We performed this test for stars\\nin the fields of J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 in both bands; residual images show no extended features\\nin any case. This is illustrated for J2255+0251 in the F356W filter in the top panels of Extended Data\\nFigure 3. We also fit galaxy + host models to pure PSF images, in which case the inferred host magnitudes\\nwere roughly two magnitudes fainter than the hosts detected around the quasars. In contrast, we clearly\\ndetect the quasar host when we use any of the five library PSFs and, using these stellar residual maps to\\nmeasure the standard deviation, we display the maps of the host signal-to-noise ratio for all images of our\\ntwo quasars in the bottom panels of Extended Data Figure 3.\\nWe carried out three sets of simulations to further validate our host detections, including J2255+0251\\nin the F356W filter and J2236+0032 in the F356W and F150W filters. In one realization of the simulation,\\nwe randomly select a PSF from the five top-ranked PSFs in the library, and add a Sérsic profile using the\\nbest-fit parameters from our model inference. We sample the resulting mock quasar +host image at the\\nobserved resolution and insert it into a random empty position in the JWST NIRCam data. We then model\\nthe images with the other four PSF stars, and select the result with the best performance. We repeated this\\nsimulation a hundred times to quantify the bias and standard deviation of the inferred values around the\\ntrue values. We found that the key Sérsic parameters can be obtained accurately, with biases well below\\n1σin all quantities. For J2255+0251, the bias (obtained −truth) and scatter of the inferred host magnitude\\nare−0.02±0.11. For J2236+0032, the magnitude bias and scatter are 0.01 ±0.14 and −0.13±0.16 for\\nF356W and F150W, respectively. We present the distributions of the inferred host magnitudes in the\\nsimulations of J2255+0251 (F356W) in Extended Data Figure 4. We note that these simulation tests were\\n12/27\\nconducted with point_source_supersampling_factor set to 1. The similar scatter distribution\\ncan be found when setting this parameter to 2.\\nFinally, we tested the fidelity of the host magnitude inference using a joint fit across the two bands. We\\nfix the host galaxy parameters for J2236+0032 (where the host is detected in F150W), setting the Sérsic\\nparameters to those inferred from F356W; we find a very similar host magnitude to the value when all\\nparameters are allowed to vary: the changes in the inferred host magnitude are within 0.1 mag.\\nStellar mass of the host galaxy\\nWe use SED fitting to estimate the stellar masses of our two host galaxies at z∼6.4using the photometry\\nand its uncertainty based on NIRCam imaging with two filters (F356W and F150W) which straddle the\\nrest-frame 4000 Å break. The host galaxy of J2255+0251 is not detected in the F150W filter, thus we\\ntake 26.3mag as a lower limit on the magnitude. We adopt a Chabrier IMF in our analysis to allow direct\\ncomparison with the local black hole - host galaxy mass relations (e.g., ref. 21,22). Contributions of\\nnebular emission lines from the host galaxies are also allowed with a uniform log ionization parameter\\nlogUover the range [−3,−1]. Three key parameters define the shape of the SED template: age, metallicity,\\nand dust attenuation (A v). We adopt a uniform prior on the age over the range [0.01, 0.84] (in Gyr),\\nextending to the age of the universe at z=6.4. We adopt a uniform prior in metallicity logZ/Z⊙over\\nthe range [−1,−0.3]following ref. 36,37. We assume an A vrange of [0, 5.0] mag for both targets. For\\nJ2255+0251, the F150W band has an upper limit on the flux thus the constraint on A vis weaker; hence,\\nwe assume A vfollows a log-normal distribution with a median value at 0.85 as supported by recent JWST\\nobservations of high-redshift galaxies38. A measurement of the Balmer decrement (i.e., the ratio of narrow\\nHαand H βin the spectrum) implies an attenuation A v=0.67±0.13 mag for the narrow-line region (Onoue\\net al., in prep), consistent with the median extinction value of our prior. We also note that for J2236+0032,\\nthe contribution of the host in the spectrum (Onoue et al., in prep) has a magnitude in close agreement\\nwith the NIRCam photometry, supporting our stellar mass estimate.\\nWe use gsf39to perform the SED model fitting. This software generates a set of templates with\\na range of ages and metallicities according to the prior to fit a composite stellar population (CSP)-like\\nstar formation history. A random parameter sampling is performed through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo\\n(MCMC) to infer the probability distribution of the SED parameters. For J2236+0032 and J2255+0251,\\nthe inferred values of log M ∗are11.12+0.40\\n−0.27and10.53+0.51\\n−0.37(in units of M⊙), respectively, as shown in\\nExtended Data Table 1. In Extended Data Figure 5, we present the best-fit SEDs of the two quasar hosts,\\nin which the MCMC inference indicates that the stellar mass is mildly sensitive to age and metallicity but\\nis more sensitive to A v. We also adopt the same configuration for the independent code Bagpipes40\\nandCIGALE41to perform SED fits; we find values of M ∗that change by 0.1 dex or less. The robust\\nmeasurement of stellar mass is due to having photometry on both sides of the 4000 Å break, accurate\\nspectroscopic redshifts, and a firm upper limit of the stellar age 0.84 Gyr, given the age of the universe at\\nz=6.4. Even so, we note that additional systematic uncertainties may be unaccounted for thus leading to\\ngreater uncertainty in the mass estimates than we have quoted.\\nNIRSpec Observations and data reduction\\nThe NIRSpec Fixed-Slit data for the two quasars were obtained on October 30, 2022 for J2236+0032 and\\nOctober 28, 2022 for J2255+0251. The targets were aligned onto the 0.′′2×3.′′2S200A2 slit and observed\\nwith the medium-resolution ( R∼1000 ) G395M grating, which covers 2.87 – 5.27 µm in the observed\\nframe. Total exposures of 1,970 seconds were obtained for each target.\\nThe spectroscopic data were processed with the JWST pipeline version 1.8.5. Raw ( uncal ) data\\nwere downloaded from the MAST archive, which has the parameter reference files jwst_1027.pmap .\\n13/27\\nThe stage 1 calibration was performed with the default parameters but with the function to detect large\\ncosmic-ray hits on the detector turned on during the Jump step. The 1/fnoise along the vertical direction\\nwas subtracted from the Stage 1 products using the same method as that for NIRCam images. Pixels\\nof the science frames flagged as bad or saturated were masked based on the associated Data Quality\\nframes. During the Stage 2 data processing, including flat-fielding and flux calibration, we use in-flight\\nmeasurements of spectrophotometric standard stars ( jwst_nirspec_fflat_0065.fits ) to convert the detector\\nsignals into physical units. The signal loss due to the optical system and the finite width of the S200A2\\nslit were corrected in the Pathloss step by applying built-in correction factors for a point source as a\\nfunction of wavelength. The two-dimensional spectra at each dither position were then stacked using\\nthe Stage 3 pipeline. The pixel resampling scale was kept to the original pixel scale of the detector. A\\n6-pixel-wide box-car aperture (0 .′′6 wide) was employed to extract the one-dimensional spectrum from the\\nstacked spectrum.\\nSpectrum fitting\\nWe use a public code QSOFitMORE42(version 1.2.03) with custom modification to fit the NIRSpec\\nrest-optical spectra of the two quasars. The continuum emission is fitted with two components: power-law\\nemission from the accretion disk, and a pseudo-continuum from the forest of singly-ionized iron emission.\\nQSOFitMORE uses an empirical iron template of ref. 43. The rest-frame 5100 Å monochromatic\\nluminosity ( L5100) is derived from the best-fit power-law continuum model with a power-law index of αλ\\n(i.e., flux density Fλ∝λαλ).\\nEmission lines are modeled with a combination of one or more Gaussian profiles. J2236+0032 needs\\none broad component for H β, while the adjacent forbidden emission of [O III]λλ4960 ,5008 requires\\none narrow component and another blueshifted broad component. The narrow [O III] doublet is forced to\\nhave the same line width without velocity offsets between the two. The [O III] redshifts of the two targets\\nare derived from the peaks of the narrow [O III] components. The [O III] redshift of J2236+0032 agrees\\nwell with the location of the absorption lines we detect in H γ, Hδ, and H ε(Figure 3). The H β+[O III] line\\nprofile as well as the continuum properties of J2236+0032 are reported in Extended Data Table 2. A full\\ndescription of the fitting procedure and other emission line properties will be presented in Onoue et al. (in\\nprep.).\\nBH mass estimates\\nThe central black hole masses M BHof the two quasars are measured by the single-epoch method using\\nbroad H βemission lines. Assuming that the broad H βemission traces the kinematics of the gas orbiting\\nin the vicinity of the SMBHs (the so-called broad-line-region), one can use the line width of H βas a proxy\\nof the rotation velocity of the broad-line-region gas. There is also an empirical correlation between the\\nrest-frame 5100 Å continuum luminosity ( L5100) and the radius from the SMBH to the broad-line-region\\ngas, which is observed by the reverberation mapping technique44. In this paper, we use the recipe provided\\nby ref. 16 to estimate the black hole mass:\\nMBH=106.91\\x12L5100\\n1044erg s−1\\x130.50\\x12FWHM Hβ\\n103km s−1\\x132\\nM⊙. (1)\\nBased on the spectrum fitting results described above, we derive virial BH masses of M BH= (1.54±\\n0.27)×109M⊙for J2236+0032 and M BH= (2.02±0.17)×108M⊙for J2255+0251. Note that these\\n3https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4893646\\n14/27\\nvirial SMBH masses have intrinsic uncertainties of 0.4 dex16, which is not included in the error budget\\nabove. We report the derived BH properties in Extended Data Table 2.\\nWe estimate the host galaxy contribution to the rest-optical continua of the NIRSpec spectra, using the\\ndecomposed host galaxy images in the NIRCam’s F356W filter. Referring to the relative position angle\\nof the NIRCam and NIRSpec observations, we find that the stellar emission falling inside the 0.′′2×0.′′6\\nextraction aperture is 21.8% (J2236+0032) and 4.8% (J2255+0251) with respect to the total emission.\\nWe interpret this as the fraction of the host starlight in the observed continuum emission in the NIRSpec\\nG395M spectrum for each source, which allows us to correct the 5100 Å continuum luminosity to that from\\nthe quasar emission alone. Accordingly, the virial BH masses become M BH= (1.36±0.15)×109M⊙\\nfor J2236+0032 and M BH= (1.97±0.17)×108M⊙for J2255+0251, respectively. These corrected BH\\nproperties are reported in Extended Data Table 2, and are adopted in Figure 4. This correction is more\\nsignificant for J2236+0032, in which stellar absorption lines are detected (Figure 3).\\nEmission from H β+[O III] in the hosts\\nOur SED model allows for the inclusion of the H β+[O III] line emission that falls within the F365W filter\\n(Extended Data Figure 5). However, if those lines were of high equivalent width in the hosts, they could\\naffect the broad-band photometry used in the stellar mass inference, especially if the gas is ionized by\\nthe quasar45,46. To ensure that our NIRCam detection of extended host emission is not dominated by\\nthese lines, we directly compare the total flux of the H β+[O III] narrow lines seen in our spectra with the\\ncontribution from the host in the NIRCam image within the aperture of the spectral slit. For J2236+0032,\\nnarrow H βemission is not detected and the [O III] emission in NIRSpec contributes only ∼3%of the\\nhost galaxy light.\\nFor J2255+0251, the narrow H β+[O III] emission is comparable to the host galaxy brightness measured\\nin the F356W filter. Much of this emission may be coming from the narrow-line region of the quasar itself.\\nTo quantify the impact on the detection of the stellar continuum, we use the 2D NIRSpec spectroscopic\\ndata and fit a Gaussian to the unresolved spatial profile at each wavelength, allowing the centroid to\\nvary linearly with wavelength, setting the width to be the same as the spatial PSF as measured from a\\npublicly available reference star in the same spectroscopic configuration as our observations, and letting\\nthe amplitude be a free parameter. The best-fit Gaussian profile at each wavelength is then subtracted\\nfrom the 2D spectrogram to reveal any spatially extended [O III] emission in the spectrum. A background\\nregion of equivalent size is subtracted from the extended emission region. We calculate the flux density of\\nthe extended emission in the F356W band and compare it to the flux density of the NIRCam host galaxy\\nwithin the aperture of the NIRSpec slit on the sky. For J2255+0251, the [O III] extended emission has a\\nmagnitude of 27.6, which is 11% of the flux of the observed host galaxy within the slit aperture. Note that\\nthe measurement of the extended emission is based on the observational fact that the apparent minor axis\\nof J2255+0251 is wider than the scale of the PSF in F356W (see Figure 2). We thus conclude that the\\nmajority of the narrow H β+[O III] emission in J2255+0251 comes from the unresolved quasar, which has\\nbeen removed by our quasar decomposition. For J2236+0032, we use the same approach and find that the\\nextended [O III] has a magnitude of 27.5 mag. The flux ratio between the extended [O III] and the host\\ngalaxy within the slit is ∼3%. No extended H βemission was detected in either target.\\nConstruction of mock quasar and host galaxy sample at z =6.4\\nWe use the method described in ref. 17to generate mock samples to assess the expected location of our\\ntwo quasars in the black hole - stellar mass plane. We start with a large galaxy sample representative of\\nthe population at z∼6based on the stellar mass function15. We then assume that the ratio of black hole to\\nhost stellar mass and its dispersion are the same as the local values (i.e., no evolution). As an update on\\n15/27\\nthis procedure, we now use the BH Eddington rate distribution of ref. 47to assign quasar luminosities.\\nObservational uncertainty on M ∗and intrinsic uncertainty on M BHare incorporated with a selection on\\nmagnitude ( −23.9<M1450<−23.8) is applied. The orange contours in Figure 4 show the resulting\\nbivariate probability distribution in the stellar mass-black hole mass plane. We further generate samples\\nfor different evolution rates (M BH/M∗∝(1+z)γ) in steps of 0.1 in γand under the assumption that the\\ndispersion is the same as the local value (ref. 17,48demonstrates that the evolution rate and dispersion are\\ndegenerate). The probability distribution of γis determined given our measurements of both M BHand M ∗\\nof our two quasars (Extended Data Figure 6); γlies in the range −0.40 to +0.84 with 68% confidence.\\n23.Matsuoka, Y ., et al.

Introduction\\nQuasars, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in general, are powered by accretion onto the\\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of their host galaxies. Quasars are the most\\nluminous non-transient sources in the Universe, and have been observed up to a redshift\\nofz∼7.6 (Wang et al. 2021b). SMBH activities are a key ingredient of galaxy formation.\\nQuasars provide crucial probes of galaxy evolution and cosmology across cosmic history at\\nthree critical spatial scales:\\n1. At the scale of the AGN central engine ( <1pc), quasar emission originates from well\\nwithin the SMBH sphere of inﬂuence, at which the gravitational inﬂuence of the BH\\ndominates. Quasars are fundamental in understanding the physics of BH accretion\\nand growth and the physics of AGN activity.\\n2. At the scale of quasar host galaxies ( ∼1−10 kpc), the evolution of quasars and\\ngalaxies are strongly coupled, as shown by the tight correlation between SMBH mass\\nand the mass/velocity dispersion of their host galaxies seen at low redshift (e.g, the\\nM-σrelation, Kormendy & Ho 2013). Quasars are key to understand the assembly,\\n2 Fan et al.\\ngrowth and quenching of massive galaxies.\\n3. At the scale of galaxy clusters and superclusters ( >Mpc), quasars can be used to\\nprobe the growth of early large scale structure. They also provide sightlines to study\\nthe properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM), including the history of cosmic\\nreionization, the chemical enrichment of the IGM, the distribution of baryons and\\nthe evolution of ionization state of the IGM, and its connection to galaxy formation\\nthrough the circumgalactic medium (CGM).\\nThe history of quasar studies is driven and shaped by innovations in systematic surveys\\nand multiwavelength observations of quasars. These observations aim to reaching higher\\nredshift, covering the full range of quasar luminosities, and spatially resolving quasar hosts\\nand their central AGN structure. Studies of high-redshift quasars within the ﬁrst few billion\\nyears of cosmic history started with the advent of large area digital or digitized sky surveys,\\nhighlighted by progress made using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York\\net al. 2000), which resulted in the ﬁrst detections of quasars at z>5 andz>6 (Fan et al.\\n2001). Observations of z∼6 quasars in the early 2000s provided fundamental insights in\\nthe three key scales of galaxy evolution mentioned above:\\n1. SMBHs with masses up to a few billion M⊙already existed in the Universe within\\none billion years after the Big Bang, requiring a combination of early massive BH\\nseeds and rapid BH accretion.\\n2. Early luminous quasars are sites of intensive galaxy-scale star formation and the\\nassembly of early massive galaxies.\\n3. Detection of strong IGM absorption in quasar spectra, especially the emergence of\\ncomplete Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs (Gunn & Peterson 1965) shows a rapid\\ntransition of the ionization state of the IGM at z∼5−6, marking this epoch as the\\nend of cosmic reionization.\\nIn this review, we will focus on the progress since then, including the quests for the\\nearliest quasars, and the detailed studies of quasars during and right after the epoch of\\nreionization (EoR). We will limit our discussions to: (1) the redshift range of z > 5.3;\\nthis is the lower redshift limit at which there are still detectable signatures of reionization\\nactivity. This redshift corresponds to 1.1 Gyr after the Big Bang, when the Universe was at\\n8% of its current age. We consider z>5.3 as “cosmic dawn” in the context of this review.\\n(2) Luminous Type-1 quasars, for which secure spectroscopic observations and systematic\\nsurveys are currently possible. (3) IGM studies using quasar absorption spectra; we will\\nnot discuss other probes of EoR in detail. This review will focus mainly on observations,\\nand we will discuss theories and simulations largely in the context of understanding and\\npredicting observations.\\nAt the time of this review, JWST has started routine observations, and initial JWST\\nresults have begun to appear in the literature. We will not include any early JWST results\\nin this article. JWST observations of high-redshift quasars will undoubtedly provide many\\nnew insights that will result in discoveries and challenges that should be the subject of a\\nfuture review.\\nThere have been a number of excellent Annual Review articles on related topics which\\nwe will not repeat: Inayoshi et al. (2020) reviewed topics related to the initial BH seeds and\\nearly growth; Kormendy & Ho (2013) presented a very detailed discussion of BH/galaxy co-\\nevolution; Carilli & Walter (2013) reviewed early (pre-ALMA) sub/mm observations of high-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 3\\nredshift galaxies; including quasar hosts. Fan et al. (2006a) discussed early observational\\nstudies of reionization; McQuinn (2016) provided a general discussion of the evolution of\\nthe IGM.\\nThis review is organized as follows: In Section 2, we will review the progress in searching\\nfor the highest redshift quasars and in establishing large sample of quasars at cosmic dawn,\\nas a result of the new generations of wide-ﬁeld sky surveys and the developments in data\\nmining and machine learning. In this Section, we will present a database of all published\\nType-1 quasars at z > 5.3. In Section 3, we will discuss the evolution of quasars as a\\npopulation at high redshift, and present the measurements of quasar luminosity function,\\nand the trend in the evolution of quasar intrinsic properties in early epochs. We will also\\nhighlight special populations of high-redshift quasars. In Section 4, we will discuss the use\\nof high-redshift quasars as probes to the history of SMBH growth in the early Universe,\\nand review statistics of measurements of quasar BH masses and accretion characteristics.\\nIn Section 5, we will review the observations of quasar host galaxies from the rest-frame UV\\nto far-IR, in the context of the co-evolution of early SMBH growth and galaxy formation,\\nand the roles quasar played in early galaxy and structure formation. In Section 6, we\\nwill review the the progress in using IGM absorption in quasar sight lines and properties\\nof quasar proximity zones to probe the history of cosmic reionization and IGM chemical\\nenrichment. Throughout this review, we assume a spatially ﬂat LCDM cosmological model\\nwith Ωm= 0.3 andH0= 70 km s−1Mpc−1, consistent with the ﬁnal Planck results.\\n2. THE QUASAR REDSHIFT FRONTIER\\nAdvances in the studies of high-redshift quasars are ﬁrst and foremost driven by advances in\\nhigh-redshift quasar surveys and new discoveries. The quasar redshift frontier continues to\\nexpand as a result of new sky surveys: the ﬁrst quasar discoveries at z>4 in the 1980s were\\nmade possible by digital or digitized large sky surveys and the ﬁrst implementations of color\\ndrop-out selection techniques (e.g., Warren et al. 1987). After the SDSS discoveries of the\\nﬁrstz>5 (Fan et al. 1999) and z>6 (Fan et al. 2001) quasars in the early 2000s, wide-ﬁeld\\nnear-infrared (NIR) sky surveys in the following decade, such as UKIDSS (Lawrence et al.\\n2007) led to the detection of the ﬁrst quasars at z >7 (e.g., Mortlock et al. 2011), deep\\ninto the EoR. At the time of this review, the quasar redshift frontier stands at z= 7.64\\n(Wang et al. 2021b). Meanwhile, increasingly large samples of high-redshift quasars are\\nestablished by continued mining and systematic spectroscopic followup observations based\\non these new surveys. Currently, about 1000 quasars have been discovered at z >5, and\\nmore than 200 at z>6.\\n2.1. Progress in High-Redshift Quasar Surveys\\nSurveys of the highest redshift quasars face three technical challenges. First, quasars at\\ncosmic dawn are among the rarest objects in the Universe. The ﬁnal SDSS z∼6 quasar\\nsample covers more than 11,000 deg2, but contains only 52 quasars (Jiang et al. 2016).\\nTheir discoveries require large surveys that cover a signiﬁcant fraction of the sky. The\\nsecond challenge is often referred to as “ﬁnding needles in a haystack”. Most high-redshift\\nquasar surveys are based on Lyman break dropout selections using optical and NIR pho-\\ntometric survey data. However, other populations of celestial objects, in particular cool\\ngalactic dwarfs with spectral types M, L and T (usually referred as MLTs) and compact\\n4 Fan et al.\\nearly-type intermediate-redshift galaxies, have similar optical and NIR colors. Barnett et al.\\n(2019) show that these contaminant populations outnumber z∼7 quasars by 2–4 orders of\\nmagnitude in deep photometric surveys. A number of photometric selection techniques have\\nbeen developed, and the choices of how to apply these techniques require careful consider-\\nation of the balance between selection eﬃciency and completeness. Finally, spectroscopic\\nidentiﬁcations of candidate quasars require observations on large aperture telescopes. Until\\nrecently, such observations were only possible with single-object spectroscopy because the\\nlow spatial density of high-redshift quasars. The demand of telescope resources for discovery\\ndrives the need for both high selection eﬃciency and sometimes special observing strategies.\\nFor example, Wang et al. (2017) improved spectroscopic identiﬁcation eﬃciency by using\\nlow-resolution ( R∼300) long-slit NIR spectroscopy, which could capture the prominent\\nLyman break features in the quasar spectra and reject contaminants with shorter exposure\\nthan higher resolution spectra, which is more common for quasar spectroscopy followup\\nwork, would require.\\n5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5\\nRedshift−28\\n−26\\n−24\\n−22\\n−20M1450(UV magnitude)\\n2019≤year≤2022\\n2016≤year<2019\\n2000≤year<2016\\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2020\\nYear0200400600z≥5.3 quasarsTotal = 531\\nFigure 1\\nDistribution of all known z≥5.3 quasars in the absolute magnitude-redshift plane (top panel).\\nThe shaded areas are the parameter space probed by selected large quasar survey programs.

The intrinsic spectra of quasars\\n(Fig 5) in the rest-frame UV and optical are characterized by a blue power-law continuum\\nand a number of strong broad emission lines. At z >3, the strong IGM neutral hydrogen\\n(HI) absorption from Lyman series lines and Lyman continuum redshifts into the observed\\noptical wavelength. Thus high-redshift quasars are “dropout” objects with a strong Lyman\\nbreak with the dropout bands correspond to the observed wavelength of the Lyman break.\\nAt longer wavelength, quasars have blue broad-band colors due to their power law contin-\\nuum. The Lyman dropout selection method for quasars has been used since the discoveries\\nof the ﬁrstz>4 quasars (Warren et al. 1987). A more recent development is the inclusion\\nof mid-IR (MIR) photometric surveys in the candidate selection (e.g. Wu et al. 2015). The\\nlong wavelength baseline from NIR to MIR, in particular using the WISE (Wright et al.\\n2010) data, allows more eﬀective separation of high-redshift quasars and MLT dwarfs by\\ncolors.\\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\\ny−J0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5J−W1\\n6.06.5 7.0 7.2\\nML\\nT\\nFigure 2\\nExample of y −J vs. J −W1 color-color diagram used for high-redshift quasar selections.

(2019).\\nFig. 2 illustrates how to use the combination of optical and IR colors to select z >6.5\\nquasars. At z∼6.5, the strong Ly αemission line is in the yband. At higher redshift, this\\nband starts to be dominated by IGM absorption and quasars become “y-dropouts” with\\nincreasing red y−Jcolors. Meanwhile, the J−W1 color is determined by the quasar power\\nlaw continuum and has a near constant value, which is redder than most of the sub/stellar\\nobjects with spectral types earlier than L. The main contaminants for this redshift range\\nare L and T dwarfs.\\nInayoshi et al. (2020) presented a summary table of the photometric surveys used in\\nthe discoveries of z >6 quasars in the past ﬁfteen years. Early surveys such as SDSS and\\nPS1 (Chambers et al. 2016) used 2–4 meter class telescopes with relatively short exposure\\n6 Fan et al.\\ntimes, thus they are optimized to discover rare, luminous quasars in large sky areas. Se-\\nlection of fainter quasars requires photometric observations on large aperture telescopes:\\nthe SHELLQs project (Matsuoka et al. 2022) is based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)\\nsurvey on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope (Aihara et al. 2018). As shown in Fig 2, at z >7,\\nquasars begin to drop out in the yband at the red limit of CCD detector sensitivities.\\nThe discovery of quasars at this redshift requires the combination of wide-ﬁeld IR surveys\\nthat provide detection of the quasar rest-frame UV continuum, and deep optical surveys\\nthat sample the strong Lyman break. Following the ﬁrst quasar discovery at z >7 using\\nphotometric data from the UKIDSS survey (Mortlock et al. 2011), there have been eight\\nquasars published at z >7 (see Table 1). The current redshift frontier is represented by\\nthe three luminous quasars known at z>7.5, selected using a combination of NIR, optical,\\nand MIR (WISE) surveys: J1342+0928 at z= 7.54 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2018); J1007+2115\\natz= 7.52 (“P¯ oniu¯ a’ena”, Yang et al. 2020b); and J0313-1806 at z= 7.64 (Wang et al.\\n2021b).\\n2.2. Optimization of Photometric Selection of High-Redshift Quasars\\nThe vast majority of high-redshift quasars have been discovered using color selection. The\\nmost commonly used method is to implement a series of “color cuts”: select objects that\\nmeet a set of criteria in the ﬂux/ﬂux-error space (usually referred to as the “color space”) as\\nhigh-redshift quasar candidates. These cuts are often initially guided by a combination of\\nphotometry of existing high-redshift quasars and simulated colors based on synthetic quasar\\nspectra, as well as observed and simulated data of the contaminant populations. These cuts\\nare reﬁned as surveys progress with larger training sets and better understanding of the\\ncontaminant populations. Fan (1999) presented an early example of color space simulation\\nof diﬀerent populations of objects with compact morphology (quasars, normal stars, white\\ndwarfs and compact galaxies) in the SDSS photometric system. This simulation was used\\nto formulate color selections for both the SDSS main spectroscopic survey (Richards et al.\\n2002) and selections of z∼6 quasars (Fan et al. 2001). Works such as Hewett et al. (2006),\\nMcGreer et al. (2013), Barnett et al. (2019), and Temple et al. (2021) expanded these\\nsimulations by including more realistic quasar population models and models of MLT and\\nintermediate-redshift galaxies, extending to higher redshifts, and including NIR and MIR\\nphotometric bands.\\nHigh-redshift surveys based on SDSS (e.g., Jiang et al. 2016), PS1 (e.g., Ba˜ nados et al.\\n2016) as well as works using the DESI Legacy Survey (e.g., Wang et al. 2019) used color\\ncuts as their primary selection method. The color cut method is simple to implement, and\\nhas high selection completeness even for objects that have unusual spectral features such\\nas broad absorption lines (BALs), weak emission lines or those with modest reddening,\\nbecause the color cuts are usually fairly loose and cover a large portion of color space, and\\nthe strong Lyman break is not strongly aﬀected by the intrinsic quasar SEDs. On the\\nother hand, because all candidates that satisfy the cuts are selected without considering\\nthe relative density distribution of the targeted (quasar) population and the contaminant\\npopulations (primary MLTs and compact galaxies), or how the candidate SEDs match the\\nquasar template, color cut selection tends to have a higher contamination rate. For example,\\nWang et al. (2019) ﬁnd a 30% spectroscopic success rate when searching for z>6.5 quasars.\\nThe contamination grows signiﬁcantly worse for z∼7.5 (F. Wang, private communication).\\nA number of techniques have been applied to improve the eﬃciency of color selection.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 7\\nThese improvements are especially important for quasars at the highest redshift ( z>6.5),\\nwhere quasars are increasingly rare compared to the contaminant populations, and at fainter\\nﬂuxes for which increasing photometric errors results in more contaminants scatter into the\\nselected area in color space. Mortlock et al. (2012) ﬁrst introduced a selection algorithm\\nbased on Bayesian model comparison (BMC). In BMC, the posterior quasar probability for\\na given object with survey photometry dis given by :\\nPq=p(q|d) =Wq(d)\\nWq(d) +Wb(d) +Wg(d), 1.\\nwhere q, b, and g represent quasar, brown dwarf (MLTs), and galaxy populations, re-\\nspectively. The weights W for each population are calculated using a population model\\nthat describes its surface density distribution integrated over a Gaussian likelihood func-\\ntion based on model colors. BMC wss applied by Mortlock et al. (2011) to data from the\\nUKIDSS survey to identify the ﬁrst quasar at z>7. The SHELLQs survey (Matsuoka et al.\\n2022) used BMC to select faint quasars in the HSC survey with great success in achieving\\na high spectroscopic identiﬁcation rate ( ∼75%) even at the low-luminosity end at z∼6.\\nWagenveld et al. (2022) presented a similar probabilistic approach that also includes radio\\ndata in the selection.\\nReed et al. (2017) applied a SED ﬁtting method for high-redshift quasar selection. In\\nthis method, after the initial color cuts, reduced χ2values are calculated for each candidate,\\nmatching the observed colors of the candidate observed SEDs to a series of model SEDs,\\nincluding diﬀerent MLT spectral types as well as early type galaxies at various redshifts.\\nObjects with high reduced χ2for the contaminant populations, and low values for the\\nquasar SED models are selected as quasar candidates.\\nBarnett et al. (2021) presented a detailed comparison study of diﬀerent selection tech-\\nniques in searching for z >6.5 quasars using VIKING survey data. They show that BMC\\nis highly complete in recovering previously known quasars in the survey area, and at the\\nsame time eﬀectively rejects conﬁrmed contaminants. Using simulations, they calculate the\\nsurvey selection function – completeness as a function of quasar redshift and luminosity, and\\nﬁnd that both BMC and the SED method represent a signiﬁcant improvement in selection\\ncompleteness and depth compared to simple color cuts.\\nWenzl et al. (2021) used a random forest supervised machine learning method to select\\nz>5 quasars from PS1 data with high eﬃciency. Nanni et al. (2022) proposed an alternative\\nprobabilistic approach, in which the density of the contaminant populations in color space\\nis modeled as Gaussian mixtures based on observed photometric data and calculated using\\nthe extreme deconvolution technique, instead of using simulated population models.\\nHigh-redshift quasar selection can also be considered in the context of supervised ma-\\nchine learning. The training sets of existing objects are small, and in most case are subject\\nto the bias of previously selected samples or extrapolations from low-redshift populations.\\nThe choice of high-redshift quasar selection algorithm in a given survey is a tradeoﬀ be-\\ntween completeness and eﬃciency. Selections that rely on SED and contaminant population\\nmodels run the risk of missing objects that are highly valuable but have unusual properties.\\nAn example is the discovery of J0100+2802, the most luminous unlensed quasar currently\\nknown atz >5 (Wu et al. 2015). The object was assigned as low priority in the original\\nSDSS survey due to its relatively red color and bright apparently magnitude, indicating\\nhigh probability of it being a brown dwarf. It is not surprising that record-breaking discov-\\nery is made often – but not always (e.g., Mortlock et al. 2011) – using the less restrictive\\n8 Fan et al.\\ncolor-cut method, and probabilistic methods are more eﬀective once a large training set has\\nbeen established.\\nIf high-redshift quasar candidates could be part of the overall target selection in a large\\nautomated spectroscopic survey program, then the color selection could be relaxed to be\\nmore complete and less sensitive to templates or model assumptions, because high-redshift\\nquasar candidates are rare and are thus only a small fraction of the total targets. The\\nSDSS main quasar survey (Richards et al. 2002) targeted quasars up to z∼5.4. The Dark\\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI, Abareshi et al. 2022) is using spectrographs with\\n5000 ﬁbers on the 4-m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak to conduct a 5-year spectroscopic\\nsurvey of∼40 million galaxies, quasars and stars. DESI is expected to more than double\\nthe number of quasars known at z>5 when completed. A similar survey is being planned\\nfor the 4MOST project (Merloni 2019).\\nOther established quasar selection methods include variability, astrometry (i.e., lack of\\nproper motion; Lang et al. 2009), detections in X-ray and radio wavelengths, MIR colors,\\nas well as wide-ﬁeld slitless spectroscopy. Except for the last method (e.g., Schneider et al.\\n1989, 1999), most selection methods are not sensitive to the quasar redshifts. Therefore,\\nsome color cuts are usually used to identify high-redshift quasar candidates. McGreer\\net al. (2006) and Zeimann et al. (2011) report the ﬁrst discoveries of radio-loud z > 6\\nquasars by matching radio surveys such as FIRST with optical photometric surveys. X-ray\\nobservations provide fundamental probes of AGN evolution across cosmic time. New wide-\\nﬁeld X-ray surveys such as e-ROSITA (Wolf et al. 2021) will enable selections of luminous\\nX-ray quasars at the highest redshifts. We will discuss the X-ray and radio properties of\\nhigh-redshift quasars in Sec 3.2.\\n2.3. A Database of z>5.3Quasars\\nAt the time of this review, there are 531 z≥5.3 quasars in the published literature.\\nWe present their spectra in Fig 3. The locations of the z≥5.3 quasars on the redshift-\\nluminosity plane is shown in Fig 1.

Future Quasar Surveys\\nNew surveys are on the horizon to further expand the quasar redshift frontier. The Legacy\\nSurvey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will cover the southern\\nsky at optical wavelengths to unprecedented depths. LSST will reach 5 σco-added depths in\\nthezandybands at 25−26 mag level in 5-10 years (Ivezi´ c et al. 2019), allowing selections of\\nseveral thousand quasars and AGN at z∼6−7.5 using both color and variablity selection\\nmethods, while providing deep photometry in the dropout bands for selection of z > 7\\nquasars. ESA’s Euclid mission will provide deep near-IR photometry not possible with\\nground-based observations. It will cover 15,000 deg2of the sky to a 5 σdepth of 24 mag in\\nY, J and H bands (Scaramella et al. 2022), enabling selection of quasar candidates up to\\nz∼10. Barnett et al. (2019) predicted that Euclid + LSST will allow discoveries of ∼25\\nquasars atz>7.5, including∼8 beyondz>8, although the exact yields strongly depend\\non the assumed evolution of quasar luminosity function. Further in the future is NASA’s\\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will cover a smaller area in its High Latitude\\nSurvey but reaching about two magnitude deeper.\\nFan et al. (2019a) show that by extrapolating the current measurement of the quasar\\nluminosity function, there will be only one “SDSS”-like quasar ( M1450<−26, powered by\\nbillion-M⊙SMBH) over the entire observable universe at z>9. The combination of LSST,\\nEuclid and Roman will allow the discovery of the earliest luminous quasars in the Universe.\\nHowever, in addition to the challenges of their selection (Barnett et al. 2019, Nanni et al.\\n2022), their spectroscopic identiﬁcation will require IR spectrographs more powerful than\\nthose with the current ground-based telescopes: 30m-class extremely large telescopes and\\nJWST will be the primary tools for their conﬁrmation and follow-up observations.\\n3. AN EVOLVING QUASAR POPULATION\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst review the evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at high\\nredshift, which directly constrains the growth history of early SMBHs (Sec 3.1). The number\\ndensity of quasars is found to decline rapidly towards high redshift, in sharp constrast to\\nthe lack of strong evolution in the SEDs of quasars (Sec 3.2), from X-ray to radio, and in\\nparticular in the rest-frame UV to NIR, at which the quasar SED peaks, although a number\\nof sub-types of quasars appear to be more common at z>5−6.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 11\\n3.1. Evolution of Quasar Luminosity Function\\nSoon after the initial discovery of quasars, Schmidt (1968) found that their density rises\\nsharply with redshift up to z≳2. Wide-ﬁeld surveys such as 2dF (Boyle et al. 2000) and\\nSDSS (Richards et al. 2006b) established that the density of luminous quasars peaks at\\nz∼2−3. Osmer (1982) presented the ﬁrst evidence that quasar density at z>3.5 appears\\nto be declining. Schmidt et al. (1995) characterized this decline as an exponential function\\nwith redshift:\\nρ(z)∝10kz, 2.\\nwherekis measured to be ∼−0.5 atz∼3−5. The shape of the QLF is usually described\\nas a double, or broken, power law:\\nΦ(M1450,z) =Φ∗(z)\\n100.4(α+1)(M1450−M∗\\n1450)+ 100.4(β+1)(M1450−M∗\\n1450)3.\\nwhereM1450is the absolute magnitude of the quasar continuum at rest-frame 1450 ˚A,αand\\nβare the faint-end and bright-end slopes, respectively, M∗\\n1450is the characteristic absolute\\nmagnitude or break magnitude measured at 1450 ˚A, and Φ∗is the normalization of the LF\\nwhich has an exponential decline described in Eq. 2.\\nEarly high-redshift surveys such as the SDSS were only sensitive to the most luminous\\nquasars. Based on a sample of nine SDSS quasars at z >5.7, Fan et al. (2004) found that\\natz∼6, the co-moving spatial density of quasars with M1450<−26.7 is 6×10−10Mpc−3,\\nconsistent with extrapolation from lower redshift trends. Jiang et al. (2009) extended the\\nSDSS quasar survey to the “stripe 82” region, reaching two magnitudes deeper than the\\nSDSS main survey. They found a bright end slope βbetween –2.6 and –3.1. Willott et al.\\n(2010) combined the faint quasars discovered in the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey\\n(CFHQS) with the brighter SDSS quasars, and presented the ﬁrst measurement of QLF at\\nz∼6 using a sample of 40 quasars. They found a bright end slope β=−2.81 and a break\\nmagnitude M∗\\n1450=−25.1; the faint end slope was still poorly constrained at this redshift.\\nJiang et al. (2016) presented the ﬁnal results of the z∼6 quasar survey in the SDSS\\nfootprint. Using this sample of 52 quasar at 5 .7<z< 6.4, they found a bright end slope of\\nβ=−2.8±0.2. In addition, they found a density evolution with the exponential evolution\\nparameter k=−0.72±0.11, a signiﬁcantly steeper slope than the value at z∼3−5,\\nsuggesting an accelerated evolution of luminous quasars between z∼5 and 6.\\nThe SHELLQs project (Matsuoka et al. 2016) extended the z∼6 quasar sample to\\nsigniﬁcantly lower luminosity. Matsuoka et al. (2018) presented measurements of the QLF\\ndown toM1450∼ −22, which is well ﬁt with a double power law that has a faint-end\\nslopeα=−1.23+0.44\\n−0.34, a bright-end slope β=−2.73+0.23\\n−0.31, and a break magnitude M∗\\n1450=\\n−24.90+0.75\\n−0.90. Their measured QLF showed a strong break and a signiﬁcant ﬂattening at\\nthe faint end at z∼6. Schindler et al. (2022) used the combination of the bright PS1\\nquasar sample that includes 125 quasars at z∼5.7−6.2 with the fainter quasars from\\nSHELLQs for a new QLF measurement at z∼6. They found a steeper bright-end slope\\nofβ=−3.84+0.63\\n−1.21, as well as a steeper faint-end slope of α=−1.70+0.29\\n−0.19, with a bright\\nbreak magnitude of M∗\\n1450=−26.38+0.79\\n−0.60. Their study yields a constant redshift evolution\\nofk∼−0.7 over a wide redshift range of z= 4−7.\\nMeasurement of the QLF becomes increasingly diﬃcult at higher redshift due to the\\nrapid decline in spatial density of quasars. Wang et al. (2019) conducted the ﬁrst mea-\\nsurement of the QLF at redshift approaching seven based on a sample of 17 quasars at\\n12 Fan et al.\\n6.45< z < 7.05 (see also Venemans et al. 2013). They found a quasar spatial comoving\\ndensity ofρ(M1450<−26) = 0.39±0.11Gpc−3atz∼6.7, and an exponential density evo-\\nlution parameter k=−0.78±0.18. The density of luminous quasars declines by a factor of\\n∼6 per unit redshift. The e-folding time of quasar density evolution and that of black hole\\naccretion (Sec 4) become comparable, underlying the strong constraints quasar evolution\\ncould place on the SMBH accretion mode.\\n−28−26−24−22\\nM1450(mag)0.0010.0100.1001.00010.000Φ(M1450,z) (Gpc−3mag−1)\\nJiang + 2016\\nMatsuoka+2018\\nSchindler+2022\\nWillott + 2010\\nJiang + 2016\\nMatsuoka+2018\\nSchindler+2022\\n(binned)\\n2 4 6\\nRedshift100101102n(M1450<−26,z) (cGpc−3)Kulkarni + 2019\\nk=−0.7\\nk=−0.78\\nGiallongo + 2019\\nMatsuoka + 2018\\nJiang + 2016\\nWang + 2019\\nSchindler+2022\\n6.0 6.5 7.00.250.500.751.001.251.501.75\\nFigure 4\\nQuasar luminosity function measurements at high-redshift.

(2022).\\nFig 4 (right panel) illustrates the overall density evolution of luminous ( M1450<−26)\\nquasars with measurements from various surveys at z= 3−7. While a strong exponential\\ndecline in the comoving spatial density of luminous quasars has been well established,\\nthere are still signiﬁcant uncertainties in the evolution of the shape of the QLF (Fig 4,\\nleft panel). As discussed in Schindler et al. (2022), the bright-end slope determination is\\nstrongly inﬂuenced by small number statistics. At the faint end, selection incompleteness\\ncould be a signiﬁcant factor when a completeness correction of ≳2 is often needed.\\nThere have been a number of ambitious eﬀorts to combine QLF measurements across\\nthe electromagnetic spectrum and diﬀerent cosmic epochs to obtain a complete picture\\nof quasar/AGN evolution from reionization to the current epoch. Hopkins et al. (2007)\\npresented the bolometric QLF up to z∼6. They explicitly modeled the X-ray column den-\\nsity distribution and SED shape variation of quasars to allow determinations of bolometric\\nluminosities of high-redshift populations. Kulkarni et al. (2019) constructed a sample of\\nmore than 80,000 color-selected quasars and AGN with a homogeneous treatment of survey\\nselection eﬀects, and derived the AGN UV luminosity function from z= 0 to 7.5. Their\\nmeasurement suggested a continued steeping of the faint end slope βand a brightening of\\nthe break magnitude. Shen et al. (2020) updated the early Hopkins et al. work. They\\nfound bolometric QLF evolution consistent with those based on UV-selected samples alone,\\nand concluded that the faint-end slope measurement is still uncertain at high-redshift.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 13\\nFor the purpose of comparison with theoretical models or making predictions of future\\nsurveys, we suggest using the combined QLF measurements presented in Kulkarni et al.\\n(2019) or Shen et al. (2020) for z≲6, where the QLF is well measured over a wide range of\\nluminosity. At z≳6, the uncertainty is still large for both the QLF shape and its redshift\\nevolution; Schindler et al. (2022) presented the most up-to-date measurements.\\nA key limitation of current high-redshift quasar surveys is that the quasar selection\\nmethods assume a blue power-law continuum in the rest-frame UV. It is possible that\\ncurrent surveys are missing signiﬁcant number of red or reddened quasars. Kato et al. (2020)\\nreported the discovery of two dust-reddened quasars at z > 5.6 in the SHELLQs survey\\nbased on their mid-IR WISE detection. Endsley et al. (2022) discovered an obscured radio-\\nloud AGN at z= 6.85 in the 1.5 deg2COSMOS ﬁeld with bolometric luminosity comparable\\nto that of luminous SDSS z∼6 quasars. Ni et al. (2020) studied the obscuration of high\\nredshift quasars using the BLUETIDES simulation, and predicted that the dust-extincted\\nUV LF is about 1.5 dex lower than the intrinsic LF, and the vast majority of z∼7 AGNs\\nhave been missed by UV-based surveys due to dust extinction. This would imply a much\\nhigher bolometric luminosity density of early quasars, and would have a profound impact\\non the growth of SMBHs and early galaxy evolution overall. A reliable determination of the\\nobscured fraction of quasars at z≳5 needs a combination of wide-ﬁeld deep X-ray survey\\nand eﬀective spectroscopic identiﬁcation of faint, obscured sources with either JWST or\\nNOEMA/ALMA.\\n3.2. (A Lack of) Evolution of the Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions\\nHigh-redshift galaxies have intrinsic blue SEDs that are dominated by young stellar popu-\\nlations. Metallicity, or chemical abundance, in their ISM has also been shown to be lower\\nthan in low-redshift galaxies (Stark 2016). However, the overall SEDs and the chemical\\nabundance in quasar broad line regions (BLRs) do not evolve signiﬁcantly with redshift, al-\\nthough quasar density decreases drastically at high-redshift. This apparent lack of spectral\\nevolution in the UV properties of quasars were noticed as soon as the ﬁrst z∼6 quasars\\nwere discovered (e.g., Barth et al. 2003, Fan et al. 2004, Iwamuro et al. 2004, Jiang et al.\\n2007). Shen et al. (2019) conducted an optical/NIR spectroscopic survey of 50 quasars at\\nz >5.7. Their observations covered the wavelength range from the Ly αto Mg iiemission\\nlines. Yang et al. (2021) presented a spectroscopic survey of 34 quasars at 6 .3< z < 7.6,\\ncovering a similar wavelength range. Both papers presented composite rest-frame UV spec-\\ntra of their high-redshift samples. Fig 5 compares the quasar composite spectra at z∼6−7\\nwith the standard low-redshift SDSS quasar composite from Vanden Berk et al. (2001). The\\naverage continuum slope and emission line strength/width do not evolve signiﬁcantly with\\nredshift, with the exception of a weaker and blueshifted C ivemission line (see discussion\\nin Sec 5.4).\\nBroad emission line ratios in quasars have been used to constrain metallicities in the\\nquasar BLR. Jiang et al. (2007) and De Rosa et al. (2014) studied emission line ratios in a\\nseries of UV lines, and found no evidence of evolution from lower redshift samples, with the\\ngas metallicity a few times solar based on photoionization modeling. This is conﬁrmed by\\nstudies using high S/N spectroscopy from the XQR30 survey ( https://xqr30.inaf.it/ )\\nof quasars at z= 5.8−7.5 (Lai et al. 2022).

Schindler et al. (2020) carried out detailed modeling of Fe iiand\\nMgiilines using a large sample of quasar spectra from VLT/Xshooter, and compared their\\nmeasurements with those in the literature. There is no evidence of evolution in the Fe/Mg\\nratio up to the highest redshift, although scatter is large at any given redshift (Fig 5). The\\nlack of spectral evolution in quasar rest-frame UV spectra, especially in the emission line\\nproperties, indicates that quasar BLRs are chemically enriched very rapidly, within the ﬁrst\\nfew hundred million years after the initial star formation in the host galaxy. This is not\\nsurprising, as we will review in Sec 5: quasar host galaxies are sites of the most intense star\\nformation in the early universe.\\nHowever, there are a few noticeable evolutionary trends in quasars at cosmic dawn that\\ncould be related to the early phase of quasar growth. In Sec 5.4, we discuss an increasing\\nfraction of quasars with strongly blue-shifted high ionization UV emission lines and with\\nstrong BAL features as evidence for early quasar feedback. In Sec 6.3.1, we present the\\ndiscovery of z∼6 quasars with IGM absorption features indicative of very young ages.\\nA subset of high-redshift SDSS quasars have much weaker UV emission lines, in par-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 15\\nticular Lyαand C iv. Diamond-Stanic et al. (2009) identiﬁed them as >3σoutliers in the\\nquasar emission line strength distributions. They represent ∼1% of quasar population at\\nz<4, after correction for selection incompleteness (Diamond-Stanic et al. 2009). Ba˜ nados\\net al. (2016) showed that this fraction increases to ∼14% among z>5.6 PS1 quasars based\\non Lyαmeasurements. Shen et al. (2019) found a similar fraction using C ivmeasurements.\\nIt remains unclear whether weak line quasars are related to the young age or high accretion\\nrate in the high-redshift quasar population (Plotkin et al. 2015)..\\nX-ray emission originates from the accretion disk and surrounding hot corona close to\\nthe central SMBH, and provides crucial information about black hole accretion and AGN\\nfeedback (Fabian 2012). Brandt et al. (2001) detected the ﬁrst z∼6 quasar in X-rays using\\nthe XMM/Newton telescope. More than 30 quasar at z≳6 have now been detected in\\nX-rays, using either the Chandra or XMM-Newton telescopes. Nanni et al. (2017) analyzed\\n29 quasars at z >5.5 with X-ray detections. They found a mean X-ray power-law photon\\nindex of Γ∼1.9, similar to that at low redshift. The optical-X-ray spectral slopes of the\\nhigh-redshift also follow the relation established at low redshift. Vito et al. (2019a) carried\\nout a similar analysis, and found a slightly steeper X-ray power-law index, consistent with\\na generally higher Eddington ratio among SMBHs in these quasars at z >6. Wang et al.\\n(2021a) extended the X-ray analysis to quasars at z∼7 (see also Pons et al. 2020). They\\nalso found a steepening of X-ray spectra with Γ ∼2.3. The optical-X-ray power-law slope,\\nαOX, traces the relative importance of the accretion disk and corono emission in quasars\\nand AGN. At low redshift, there is a tight correlation between αOXand the quasar UV\\nluminosity (e.g. Just et al. 2007). There is no evolution in this correlation up to z∼7\\n(e.g. Wang et al. 2021a). The X-ray observations show a consistent picture that the inner\\naccretion-disk and hot-corona structure in quasars was established at the highest redshift\\nwith minimal evolution in their properties across cosmic time.\\nAt rest-frame NIR and MIR wavelengths, the radiation from quasars is dominated by\\nreprocessed emission from the hot dust component beyond the accretion disk structure (see\\nreview by Lyu & Rieke 2022). At the highest redshift, dust observations (at rest-frame\\n>1.5µm) have been largely limited to photometric observations of bright sources using the\\nSpitzer (e.g., Jiang et al. 2006) and Herschel (Leipski et al. 2014) Telescopes, although this\\nwill change with the launch of JWST. These observations also showed a lack of evolution:\\nthe average IR-SEDs of quasars at z∼5−6 are consistent with low-redshift templates\\nand the hot dust structure is already in place by z∼6. Jiang et al. (2010) reported the\\ndetection of two quasars at z∼6 with weak hot dust emissions using Spitzer. Later studies\\nsuggested that these dust-deﬁcient quasars are not unique to z > 6, and examples with\\nsimilar SEDs are found even in the low-redshift PG sample (e.g. Lyu et al. 2017).\\nQuasars were initially discovered as point-like sources emitting strong radio emissions\\n(Schmidt 1963). However, the fraction of quasars that exhibit strong jet-powered radio\\nemission (radio-loud quasars) is around 10% with no signiﬁcant dependence on redshift,\\nat least up to z∼6 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2021, Gloudemans et al. 2021). The\\nhighest redshift radio-loud quasar known is at z= 6.82 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2021), and the\\nhighest redshift blazar is at z= 6.10 (Belladitta et al. 2020). It is still debated whether\\nthe seemingly constant radio-loud fraction is due to two intrinsically diﬀerent populations\\nof quasars or is a consequence of the duty cycle of jet emission during the life of a quasar.\\nIf the latter were the case, one should expect an increase in the radio-loud fraction at the\\nhighest redshifts (where the available time for a quasar shortens), something we have not\\nyet witnessed and depends on the lifetime of the radio-loud phase.\\n16 Fan et al.\\nThe lack of evolution in the radio-loud fraction discussed above concerns the compact\\ncore radio emission. However, there is an important evolution with redshift if we focus\\non the extended radio emission: the lack of giant ( ∼100s kpc) radio lobes at z >4, which\\nare common at lower redshifts (Fabian et al. 2014). Indeed, the most extended radio jet\\nknown atz∼6 is<2 kpc (Momjian et al. 2018). A plausible physical explanation is\\nthat atz >4, the CMB energy density [ ∝(1 +z)4] exceeds the magnetic energy density\\nin radio lobes. In that case, inverse Compton (IC) scattering losses will make any large\\nlobes at high redshift radio weak and X-ray bright (Ghisellini et al. 2014). The IC/CMB\\neﬀect has been challenging to probe with current X-ray telescopes. Recent deep Chandra\\nX-ray observations of the two z∼6 quasars with the most extended radio jets resulted in\\ntentative evidence of larger X-ray jets (Connor et al. 2021, Ighina et al. 2022). Obtaining\\nthis marginal evidence was expensive, even for our most powerful X-ray telescopes observing\\nthe best existing targets to test this eﬀect. To robustly measure the IC/CMB eﬀect in a\\nsample of radio-loud quasars, we will likely need to wait for the next generation of X-ray\\ntelescopes.\\nThe discussions in this subsection present a picture that on average, the intrinsic SED of\\nquasars at the highest redshift, with emission from the accretion disk (X-ray, UV/optical),\\nbroad emission line regions, hot dust, and radio jets, show little evolution from their low-\\nredshift counterparts. The AGN structure is already in place and fully formed up to the\\nhighest redshift we have observed to date.\\nJWST will enable detailed studies of the physical properties of high-redshift quasars\\nin the rest-frame optical and IR wavelengths which are not possible from the ground. It\\nwill be especially interesting to see if the dust component of the quasar population shows\\nany evolution, since dust production mechanism (e.g. Maiolino et al. 2004) and the ISM\\nconditions in the host galaxies are likely diﬀerent in early epochs. X-ray observations with\\nChandra and XMM of even the most luminous quasars at cosmic dawn can only yield a\\nsmall number of photons. Future X-ray missions (e.g. Martocchia et al. 2017) could allow\\nallow high S/N spectroscopic observations of early quasars to characterize their accretion\\nproperties (including BH spin) and X-ray obscuration.\\n4. GROWTH OF SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES IN THE FIRST BILLION\\nYEARS\\nSMBHs are thought to be ubiquitous in the centers of massive galaxies, but their formation\\nmechanism is still an outstanding question in astrophysics. Since the discovery of quasars\\natz≳6 (Fan et al. 2001), the formation and growth of SMBHs have become even more\\nintriguing and challenging to explain. In this section we will ﬁrst review the current methods\\nused to measure the BH masses at high redshift (Section 4.1), then give an overview of the\\nproperties of the observed population (Section 4.2), and the implications for early BH seeds\\nand growth (Section 4.3). Finally, we will brieﬂy describe additional methods that in the\\nnear future can be used to improve current BH mass estimates at high redshift (Section 4.4).\\n4.1. Black Hole Mass Measurements in High-redshift quasars\\nThe spectra of z≳6 quasars show the typical signatures of broad (FWHM of thousands\\nkm s−1) emission lines that are superimposed on the power-law continuum emission of the\\nquasar’s accretion disk. These broad lines are thought to emerge from a region very close\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 17\\nto the accreting BH (so-called the “broad-line region”) and thus provide a unique tool to\\nconstrain the properties of the central BH. The size of the broad-line region scales with the\\nquasar luminosity, and the width of the lines is a measure of the potential depth (Peterson\\net al. 2004). Thus, a single-epoch spectrum gives enough information to estimate the mass\\nof the central accreting BH (Vestergaard & Osmer 2009).\\nOne of the most reliable estimators of BH mass and Eddington ratio is the H βline (e.g.,\\nPark et al. 2012). At z >6, Hβis shifted to the MIR and is thus not accessible from the\\nground. As an alternative, the C ivλ1549 and Mg iiλ2800 lines have been extensively used\\nto measure BH masses of quasars at these redshifts (e.g., De Rosa et al. 2014, Farina et al.\\n2022). Estimates based on the high ionization C ivline are uncertain, as this line shows large\\nvelocity oﬀsets, implying signiﬁcant non-virialized motions (Mej´ ıa-Restrepo et al. 2018, Park\\net al. 2017). Moreover, there is mounting evidence that large C ivblueshifts (>2000 km s−1)\\nare more common at z>6 than at lower redshifts (e.g., Meyer et al. 2019, Schindler et al.\\n2020, see also Section 5.4). Therefore, in this review, we only focus on results based on\\nMgiimeasurements, which are thought to be the most reliable until H β-derived masses are\\npossible (Bahk et al. 2019; see Section 4.4).\\nOne of the most widely used relations for BH mass estimation in high-redshift quasars\\nis:\\nMBH= 106.86[FWHM(Mg ii)\\n1000 km s−1]2[L3000\\n1044erg s−1]0.5\\nM⊙, 4.\\nwhere FWHM(Mg ii) is the Full Width at Half Maximum of the Mg iiline, and L3000\\nis the luminosity at 3000 ˚A. Vestergaard & Osmer (2009) presented the scaling relation\\nfrom Equation 4. The intrinsic scatter in the relation is 0.55 dex, which dominates the\\nuncertainty for individual measurements.\\nThe theoretical maximum luminosity that a source can achieve when the gravitational\\nand radiation forces are in equilibrium is called the Eddington luminosity (Eddington 1926).\\nThe Eddington luminosity for pure ionized hydrogen in spherical symmetry is deﬁned as\\nLEdd=4πcGmpMBH\\nσT5.\\n= 1.26×1038erg s−1(MBH\\nM⊙)\\nwherecis the speed of light, Gis the gravitational constant, mpis the mass of a proton,\\nandσTis the Thomson scattering cross-section. The ratio between the bolometric and\\nEddington luminosities (referred to as Eddington ratio; λEdd=LBol/LEdd) is useful to\\nassess the quasar population’s accretion properties. While several bolometric corrections\\nare published in the literature (e.g., Runnoe et al. 2012, Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012, Duras\\net al. 2020), in this review (e.g., in Fig. 6), we adopt the bolometric correction ﬁrst presented\\nby Richards et al. (2006a) and used in several studies of high-redshift quasars (e.g., Shen\\net al. 2011, Yang et al. 2021, Farina et al. 2022):\\nLbol= 5.15×L3000, 6.\\nFarina et al. (2022) argued that bolometric luminosities estimated using equation 6 are on\\naverage in between the ones calculated using the bolometric corrections from Runnoe et al.\\n(2012) and Trakhtenbrot & Netzer (2012). In the high-redshift quasar database presented\\ninSupplementary Material we reportL3000 so the readers can apply their preferred\\nbolometric correction.\\n18 Fan et al.\\n4.2. Current Demographics\\nAt redshifts 6 .0≲z≲7.6, the Mg iiline falls in the NIR K band. The vast majority\\nof the Mg ii-based BH masses come from NIR spectra taken with powerful ground-based\\ntelescopes such as Gemini, VLT, Magellan, and Keck (Shen et al. 2019, Onoue et al. 2019,\\nYang et al. 2021, Farina et al. 2022). At the time of writing, there are 113 quasars at\\nz >5.9 with reliable Mg ii-based black hole mass estimates. Currently, there is a strong\\nbias towards luminous ( ≳1046erg s−1) quasars, but obtaining reliable measurements for\\nfainter sources is challenging with current facilities (see Onoue et al. 2019). We will need\\nJWST and ELTs to enlarge the sample towards the faint end signiﬁcantly. Fig. 6 shows the\\nbolometric luminosity and BH mass distribution for all quasars with Mg ii-based masses at\\nz >5.9. The median BH mass is 1 .3×109M⊙, while the least and most massive quasars\\nare J0859+0022 at z= 6.39 (∼4×107M⊙; Onoue et al. 2019) and J0100+2802 at z= 6.33\\n(∼1010M⊙; Wu et al. 2015), respectively.\\nThe ﬁrst samples of NIR spectroscopic observations of ≳6 quasars showed that they\\naccrete close to the Eddington limit, i.e., λEdd≈1 (e.g., Willott et al. 2003, Kurk et al. 2007,\\nDe Rosa et al. 2011). Extending the measurements to larger samples (Shen et al. 2019) or\\nprobing to fainter luminosities (Onoue et al. 2019) revealed a signiﬁcant number of quasars\\naccreting at sub-Eddington rates. The recent works by Yang et al. (2021) and Farina et al.\\n(2022) analyzed some of the largest samples of NIR spectra of z≳6 quasars. Yang et al.\\n(2021) studied 37 quasars at z>6.3 and found that these quasars have signiﬁcantly higher\\nEddington ratios (mean of 1.08 and median 0.85) than a luminosity-matched quasar sample\\nat low redshift. Farina et al. (2022) studied the NIR spectra of 135 z≳5.7 quasars (including\\nBH properties derived from Mg iiand C iv), ﬁnding that at z∼6 the Eddington ratio\\ndistributions are consistent with a luminosity-matched low-redshift sample independent of\\nthe luminosity, while there is evidence for a mild increase in the median Eddington ratios\\nforz≳6.5 (in agreement with Yang et al. 2021).\\nIn our current compilation (Fig. 6), the Eddington ratio ranges from 0 .08 to 2.70, with a\\nmedian of 0.79 and a mean of 0.92. Forty quasars exceed the nominal Eddington limit, and\\neight haveλEdd>2. These values must be considered with caution as there is a substantial\\nscatter in the BH mass estimations (see Section 4.1).\\n4.3. Constraints on Early BH Seeds and Growth\\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the SMBHs powering the ﬁrst quasars have quickly grown to enormous\\nsizes, and explaining this mass growth remains challenging.

We note that either a higher\\nϵror a<100% duty cycle would make the constraints on BH growth even tighter. Fig. 7\\nshowcases how pushing the redshift frontier makes the formation and growth of SMBHs ever\\nmore challenging. Several potential theories have been developed to explain the existence\\nof∼109M⊙BHs atz < 6. However, for the current redshift records at z∼7.5, at\\nleast under standard assumptions (i.e., Eddington-limited growth with ϵr= 0.1) only the\\nheaviest “seeds” seem to be big enough to form these sources in such a short time, although\\nthey need to have sustained accretion their entire lifetime. For a thorough overview of the\\ntheoretical BH “seeds” we refer to the review by Inayoshi et al. (2020). Other alternatives\\nnot represented in Fig. 7 involve radiative ineﬃcient/highly obscured growth ( ϵr≪0.1;\\nDavies et al. 2019) or jet-enhanced accretion growth (Jolley & Kuncic 2008). According to\\nPacucci & Loeb (2022), the discovery of one ∼1010M⊙black hole at z≳9 would exclude\\nthe entire parameter space available for ∼100M⊙seeds.\\nHowever, it is important to note that these stringent constraints mainly apply to the\\nmost massive BHs at the highest redshift.

The (Near) Future for Black Hole Mass Measurements at High Redshift\\n4.4.1. H β-derived masses. With JWST, robust H β-based mass estimates of the most dis-\\ntant quasars ﬁnally has become feasible (see Section 4.1).

We anticipate that in the upcoming years,\\nsuch measurement will be possible, at least for some selected objects, and this will be an\\nactive area of research with the ngVLA (Carilli & Shao 2018).\\n5. A MULTI WAVELENGTH VIEW OF QUASAR/GALAXY CO-EVOLUTION\\nAT THE HIGHEST REDSHIFTS\\nIn the local Universe there are tight correlations between the mass of the central SMBHs\\nand the stellar bulge of the galaxy (see review by Kormendy & Ho 2013). When and how\\nthese tight correlations arose is an open question. Constraints at the highest redshifts can\\nprovide essential clues when the time to grow a galaxy and BH is limited. Did the BH grow\\nﬁrst, and the galaxy follow? Vice versa? Or did they grow together? What are the main\\nfeedback mechanisms? How are the massive galaxies hosting quasars connected to their\\nlarge-scale environment?\\nIn this section, we will ﬁrst review the current eﬀorts to detect the gas reservoirs required\\nfor the growth of the central SMBH and the formation of stars (Section 5.1). We will then\\ngive an overview of the eﬀorts to measure the stellar UV light from the z>6 quasar hosts\\nand the recent successes in constraining their cold dust and gas via (sub)mm observations\\n(Section 5.2). We will then discuss how we can use this information to constrain BH/galaxy\\nco-evolution (Section 4.3) and describe observational evidence (or lack of) quasar feedback\\n(Section 5.4). Finally, we will give an overview of the eﬀorts for using z≳6 quasars as\\nsignposts for overdensities and large-scale structure in the early Universe (Section 5.5).\\n5.1. Quasar fueling - Ly αnebuale\\nEnormous gas reservoirs are required to grow the SMBHs seen in the highest-redshift quasars\\ncontinuously. Extended Ly αnebulae (also referred to as Ly αhalos) trace the cold gas\\nreservoirs likely feeding the central SMBH. In principle, such gas reservoirs are likely also\\nstar-forming regions (Haiman & Rees 2001, Di Matteo et al. 2017). The ﬁrst eﬀorts to look\\nfor these nebulae used narrow-band ﬁlters centered on the expected Ly αemission (e.g., Goto\\net al. 2009, Decarli et al. 2012, Momose et al. 2019) and through deep long-slit spectroscopy\\n(e.g., Willott et al. 2011, Roche et al. 2014). The implications of these detections (as well\\nas non-detections) were often diﬃcult to interpret due to slit and narrow-band ﬂux losses.\\nSometimes the same quasar observed with narrow-band imaging and long-slit spectroscopy\\nyielded conﬂicting results.\\nThe search for these Ly αnebulae had a signiﬁcant step forward with the new Inte-\\ngral Field Spectrographs (IFS) mounted on 8-m class telescopes, particularly VLT/MUSE.\\nIFS enabled 3D morphology/kinematics of the Ly αhalos (Drake et al. 2019). The most\\ncomprehensive search for Ly αhalos to date is the REQUIEM survey (Farina et al. 2019),\\ntargeting 31 z >5.7 quasars with VLT/MUSE. REQUIEM revealed 12 Ly αnebulae with\\na range of luminosities and morphologies extending up to 30 kpc. Recently, Drake et al.\\n22 Fan et al.\\n(2022) reported that the Ly αmorphology and kinematics seem decoupled from the gas in\\nthe host galaxies as traced by [C ii]emission. This result might imply that the observed\\nLyαhalos are being powered by the central SMBH instead of tracing star formation, in\\nline with recent simulations (Costa et al. 2022). Nevertheless, the resonant nature of the\\nLyαline makes it diﬃcult to disentangle the AGN/star-formation contribution completely.\\nIFS observations of additional non-resonant lines (e.g., H αwith JWST) will be needed to\\nconﬁrm these results.\\n5.2. Quasar Host Galaxy Observations - Sites of Massive Galaxy Evolution\\nGiven the extreme luminosities and inferred BH masses of these quasars, we would expect\\nthat they reside in hosts with signiﬁcant stellar mass already in place (Kormendy & Ho\\n2013). However, the brightness of their central accreting BHs has prevented direct detection\\nof the underlying starlight at (observed) optical and near-infrared wavelengths even with\\nHST (e.g., Mechtley et al. 2012, Marshall et al. 2020). JWST’s unprecedented resolution,\\nsensitivity, and wavelength coverage should overcome most of the shortcomings of previous\\nattempts, as Marshall et al. (2021) have demonstrated with simulations. Several cycle 1\\nJWST programs attempt to reveal the stellar light of z≳6 quasar hosts for the ﬁrst time.\\n1 2 3\\nlogSFRIR(Myr1)\\n0.51.01.52.02.53.03.5logSFR[CII](Myr1)\\n0510Number11 12 13log(LIR/L)\\n0 10\\nNumber8.08.59.09.510.0\\nlog(L[CII]/L)\\nRadio-loud\\nRadio-quiet\\n1-to-1 relation\\nDetected\\nUndetected\\nFigure 8\\nStar-formation distributions for radio-quiet (small points) and radio-loud (circles) quasars at\\nz≳6, derived from [C ii]and IR luminosities (Figure adapted from Khusanova et al. 2022).\\nThe radiation at observed far-IR (FIR) to mm wavelengths of z≳6 quasars is dominated\\nby the reprocessed emission from cool/warm dust in the host galaxy. These wavelengths\\nprovide the best window to study host galaxy properties, minimizing contamination from\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 23\\nthe quasar’s accretion disk emission. Pioneering works pushed the limits of mm and radio\\nfacilities to characterize the dust and the molecular and atomic gas in the ﬁrst bright\\nz≳6 quasars discovered (e.g., Bertoldi et al. 2003, Walter et al. 2003, Maiolino et al.\\n2005, Beelen et al. 2006, Wang et al. 2007, 2008). These studies were only sensitive to the\\nmost luminous systems, and found that about 1/3 of high redshift quasar host galaxies have\\nluminosity comparable to those of hyper-luminous IR galaxies ( LFIR∼1013L⊙). Assuming\\nthe dust heating came from starburst activity, this suggested enormous star formation rates\\nof 100−1000M⊙yr−1. Therefore, these early studies showed that early SMBH growth\\ncan be accompanied by extended, intense star formation and large reservoirs of dense and\\nenriched molecular gas.\\nRapid progress has been made in FIR observations of high-redshift quasar host galaxies\\nwith the advent of ALMA and major upgrades on the NOEMA interferometers (conveniently\\nlocated in diﬀerent hemispheres). The greatest advances can be divided into three major\\nareas: (i)sensitivity, (ii)resolution, (iii) multi-line tracers of the ISM.\\nSensitivity: The [C ii]158µmﬁne-structure line, which is the primary coolant of the cold\\nneutral atomic medium, has become the workhorse for studies of z≳6 quasar hosts. This\\nwas the natural choice as [C ii]is one of the brightest emission lines in star-forming galaxies\\nand its frequency at z > 6 is conveniently located in a high-transmission atmospheric\\nwindow visible with ALMA and NOEMA. [C ii]detections using the early generation of\\ninterferometers were challenging. By the time of the review of Carilli & Walter (2013),\\nthere were only two z≳6 quasars with [C ii]detections, while now that number is ∼80.\\n[Cii]line and IR continuum luminosities measurements provide independent estimates of\\nSFR. Fig 8 shows a recent compilation of the [C ii]and IR luminosities and SFRs for z≳6\\nquasar hosts.\\nEarly ALMA results demonstrated its ability to study [C ii]emission from quasar hosts\\nof both UV-bright and UV-faint z≳6 quasars (Wang et al. 2013, Willott et al. 2013).\\nThese studies motivated the push to larger samples, marking the transition from studies\\nof individual interesting sources to the ﬁrst statistical samples. Decarli et al. (2018) and\\nVenemans et al. (2018) presented results from an ALMA snapshot survey of a large sample\\nof luminous z∼6 quasars to study their FIR continuum and [C ii]properties. Remarkably,\\neven with integration time of ≲15 min on ALMA, the detection rate is ≳90% for these\\nquasars. They found typical [C ii]luminosities of 109−1010L⊙, FIR luminosities of 0 .3−\\n13×1012L⊙, and estimated dust masses of 107−109M⊙with star formation rates ranging\\nfrom 50 to 2700 M⊙yr−1. ALMA also enabled detections of FIR continuum and [C ii]\\nemission in a signiﬁcant number of UV-faint quasars at high redshift (e.g., Izumi et al.\\n2018, 2019). Overall, there are only weak correlations between the bolometric luminosity\\nof quasars (dominated by emission from accretion disk in the rest-frame UV/optical) and\\nthe FIR luminosity of the quasar hosts (dominated by star formation).\\nResolution: The unprecedented spatial resolution of ALMA allowed imaging of the ISM\\nofz >6 quasar host galaxies at sub-kpc resolution for the ﬁrst time. The ﬁrst studies at\\nkpc scales (∼0.2−0.3′′) revealed interesting morphological characteristics. For example,\\nShao et al. (2017) found ordered motion in a z= 6.13 host that can be modeled with a\\nrotating disk, Venemans et al. (2017a) report a remarkably compact ( ≲1 kpc) host galaxy\\natz= 7.08 that does not exhibit ordered motion on kpc scales, and Ba˜ nados et al. (2019a)\\nshowed that a galaxy merger hosts a z= 7.54 quasar.\\nVenemans et al. (2020) presented a survey of 27 host galaxies at z∼6 imaged at kpc\\nscale with ALMA. They showed that the [C ii]emission in the bright, central regions of the\\n24 Fan et al.\\nFigure 9\\nALMA [C ii]observations of quasar hosts reveal diverse morphologies and kinematics (ﬁgure\\nadapted from Neeleman et al. 2021).

The implied star formation rate densities at the center of these quasar hosts are a\\nfew hundred M⊙yr−1kpc−2, below the Eddington limit for star formation (although there\\nare examples of host galaxies forming stars at near the maximum possible rate, e.g., Andika\\net al. 2020, Yue et al. 2021b). Neeleman et al. (2021) modeled the kinematics of these 27\\nhost galaxies. They found a large diversity in the quasar host properties. About 1/3 of\\nthe galaxies show smooth velocity gradients consistent with emission from a gaseous disk.\\nAbout 1/3 have no evident velocity gradients, with their kinematics dominated by random\\nmotion. The ﬁnal 1/3 exhibit signatures of close companion interaction or galaxy merger\\nactivities (see Fig. 9 for examples). The highest resolution observations that currently exist\\nforz>6 quasars are 400 pc for a quasar host at z= 6.6 (Venemans et al. 2019) and 200 pc\\nfor a host galaxy at z= 6.9 (Walter et al. 2022). These two studies highlight the power\\nof ALMA by revealing complex morphologies, [C ii]cavities in the gas distribution, and in\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 25\\none case very compact dust continuum and [C ii]emission, reaching extreme densities in\\nthe central 200 pc from the SMBH. We expect that observations at comparable resolution\\nor higher will be an active area of investigation in the near future.\\nA key result of these morphological studies is that the population of host galaxies of\\nluminous early quasars is diverse. While, on average, they are sites of massive galaxy\\nassembly, they also appear to be in diﬀerent evolutionary phases. Apparently, the peak of\\nquasar activity is not tied to a particular stage of early galaxy formation in those systems.\\nFigure 10\\nBlack hole mass vs. host dynamical mass for z≳6 quasars (ﬁgure from Neeleman et al. 2021).\\nThe gray points are local galaxies and the shaded region is the best-ﬁt local relation (Kormendy &\\nHo 2013). The z≳6 sample is divided by their [C ii]morphology (see legend) and it is generally\\nabove the local relation.\\nMulti-line diagnostics: Even though the [C ii]emission line is important for redshift\\ndetermination and gas dynamics (as discussed above), it cannot constrain the physics of\\nthe ISM by itself. A suite of emission lines tracing various phases of the ISM is required to\\ncharacterize the physical conditions such as temperature, ionization, density, and metallic-\\nity. At the time of writing, this is an area of rapid development, and about a dozen quasar\\nhosts have been detected in more than one tracer. Some of the main targeted lines (in\\naddition to [C ii]) are:\\n•The neutral carbon emission [CI] 369 µmline, which traces the atomic medium in the\\nexternal shells of molecular clouds (e.g., Yang et al. 2019a, Pensabene et al. 2021).\\n•Two transitions of the [NII] line (205 µm and 122µm), which is a pure tracer of the\\nionized medium and can be used to measure the fraction of [C ii]associated with the\\nneutral medium (e.g., Novak et al. 2019, Li et al. 2020).\\n•The [OI] 146 µm line , which is sensitive to the temperature of the atomic gas in the\\ngalaxy (e.g., Li et al. 2020, Meyer et al. 2022b).\\n•The [OIII] 88 µm line , which provides critical diagnostics for the conditions of star\\nformation and the properties of massive stars (e.g., Walter et al. 2018, Hashimoto\\net al. 2019, Novak et al. 2019).\\n26 Fan et al.\\n•Several rotational CO transitions : considered as the main probe of the molecular\\ngas in dense star-forming regions (e.g., Gallerani et al. 2014, Venemans et al. 2017b,\\nNovak et al. 2019, Decarli et al. 2022, Li et al. 2022b, Pensabene et al. 2021, Yang\\net al. 2019a)\\n•Several water lines that arise in the warm, dense phase of the interstellar medium and\\na number of OH molecular lines that are usually associated with outﬂows of dense\\nmaterial (e.g., Yang et al. 2019a, Pensabene et al. 2021, 2022).\\nA combination of these diﬀerent tracers yields molecular gas masses in the range MH2∼\\n1010−1011M⊙, and ISM metallicities comparable to the solar value. Generally, the observed\\nluminosities are better modeled by photo-dissociation regions instead of X-ray-dominated\\nregions (see the review by Wolﬁre et al. 2022). The current small sample of quasars with\\nmultiple ISM tracers is highly biased towards objects bright in [C ii]. We expect that the\\ncharacterization of physical conditions of the ISM in early massive galaxies will be expanded\\nto much larger samples.\\n5.3. Constraints on Galaxy Mass and Black Hole/Galaxy Co-Evolution\\nDynamical masses of the quasar hosts can be measured using spatially and kinematically\\nresolved line observations (see Section 5.2). The dynamical mass enclosed within a radius\\nRis typically expressed as:\\nMdyn=v2\\ncirc\\nGR, 11.\\nwhereGis the gravitational constant and vcircis the maximum circular velocity of the\\ngas disk. Obtaining vcircis not trivial, as it requires knowing the inclination angle of the\\ngalaxy. Estimates of dynamical masses combined with robust BH masses (Section 4.1) make\\nit feasible to push BH/galaxy co-evolution studies to the highest accessible redshifts.\\nWang et al. (2010) measured dynamical masses using CO emission from 8 quasar hosts\\natz∼6. Assuming an average inclination angle of 40◦andR= 2.5 kpc, they found that the\\nz∼6 quasars have, on average, SMBHs a factor 15 more massive than expected from the\\nlocal BH – bulge mass relation. This result suggests that BHs in high redshift quasars either\\ngot a major head-start or grew faster than their host galaxies; if the M- σrelation existed\\natz∼6, would show a strong cosmic evolution. Numerous subsequent works have focused\\non the correlation of SMBH mass and galaxy dynamical mass at these redshifts (e.g., Wang\\net al. 2016, Decarli et al. 2018). Most of these studies had to assume an inclination angle\\nand/or an average size for the emitting gas. Neeleman et al. (2021) carried out careful\\ndynamic modeling of their [C ii]observations (including inclination and size). They found\\na mean dynamical mass of ∼5×1010M⊙for a sample of luminous z∼6 quasars with\\n∼109M⊙BHs. As shown in Fig. 10, this places them about one order of magnitude above\\nthe local relation. It is important to note that the relationship could be strongly aﬀected\\nby potential biases from selection and by using gas tracers (Huang et al. 2018, Volonteri\\n& Stark 2011). Indeed, observations of low luminosity quasars show a narrower [C ii]line\\nwidth (e.g., Willott et al. 2017, Izumi et al. 2018), placing them close to the local relation.\\nHabouzit et al. (2022) analyzed the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies in six\\ncosmological simulations with diﬀerent models for SMBH growth. Although the simulations\\nare all consistent at z∼0, they diverge at z>5, highlighting the importance of obtaining\\nrobust observational constraints at these redshifts. Li et al. (2022a) argued that to robustly\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 27\\nconﬁrm whether the highest-redshift quasar population resides above the local BH - bulge\\nmass relation, an improvement in the accuracy of mass measurements and an expansion\\nof the current sample to lower black hole masses is required. We expect that JWST will\\nenable signiﬁcant advances for BH and galaxy host masses.\\n5.4. Evidence of Quasar Feedback\\nCentral accreting SMBHs play an important role in shaping galaxy evolution (see review\\nby Fabian 2012). Indeed, to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxy masses at z= 0,\\nsimulations require that strong AGN feedback was already in place at z∼6 (e.g., Kaviraj\\net al. 2017). Below we list some of the observational evidence (with caveats) that these\\nfeedback mechanisms are taking place in the z≳6 quasar population:\\nUV Line Shifts. High-redshift quasars show asymmetric shape and velocity oﬀset of\\nhigh ionization lines, in particular the C ivline. The low-redshift quasar population shows\\nan overall blueshifted C ivline (∼800 km s−1) compared to the systemic redshift of the\\nquasar (e.g., traced by H β, Shen et al. 2011). This shift is generally understood in the\\ncontext of a strong accretion disk wind that contributes to the high-ionization lines (e.g.,\\nRichards et al. 2011). At z >6, the C ivline velocity shift is much stronger ( ∼1800 km\\ns−1, Schindler et al. 2020). Meyer et al. (2019) suggested that this redshift evolution can be\\nexplained by the C ivwinds being launched from the disk with an increased torus opacity\\nat this redshift.\\nBAL Quasars. A fraction of quasars show broad and highly blue-shifted absorption\\nfeatures in their rest-frame UV transitions. BAL features trace ionized winds in the broad\\nline region and are recognized signatures of SMBH feedback. Bischetti et al. (2022) used\\nhigh-quality spectra of quasars from the XQR30 survey to show that up to ∼50% of\\nluminous quasars at z∼6 exhibit BAL features (with outﬂow velocities up to 17% of\\nthe speed of light), compared to about 20% observed in low-redshift samples. Yang et al.\\n(2021) studied 37 quasars at 6 .3<z< 7.64 and reported a BAL fraction of ∼24%, smaller\\nthan the Bischetti et al. (2022) work but still slightly larger than what is observed at lower\\nredshifts. This potential evolution of the BAL fraction could be a result of the strong\\nfeedback associated with the rapid BH growth and galaxy assembly in the early Universe.\\nLyαhalos. The existence of extended Ly αnebulae around z≳6 quasars was discussed\\nin Section 5.1. Recently, Costa et al. (2022) performed a suite of cosmological, radiation-\\nhydrodynamic simulations to understand the origin and properties of the observed Ly α\\nhalos. The simulations unambiguously require quasar-powered outﬂows to match the ob-\\nserved properties at z≳6, providing indirect evidence for AGN feedback.\\nRadio jets . Only six galaxies hosting radio-loud quasars at z≳6 have been studied with\\nALMA and NOEMA (Rojas-Ruiz et al. 2021, Khusanova et al. 2022). Assuming no AGN\\ncontribution, their, their [C ii]- and FIR-derived star-formation properties are consistent\\nwith those reported for the much more studied radio-quiet quasars (c.f., Decarli et al. 2018,\\nVenemans et al. 2020; see Fig. 8). However, Rojas-Ruiz et al. (2021) and Khusanova et al.\\n(2022) show indirect evidence that the FIR emission of radio-loud quasars can be strongly\\naﬀected by synchrotron emission. In that case, their IR-derived star formation rates can\\nbe overestimated, implying that we might be witnessing negative AGN feedback at z >6.\\nHowever, more measurements of the FIR continuum and/or an enlarged sample are required\\nto quantify the potential impact on the population.\\n28 Fan et al.\\nBroad components of [CII] emission. Broad wings ( ≳1000 km s−1) in the [C ii]emission\\nlines are thought to be caused by AGN outﬂows. The observational evidence for these [C ii]\\nbroad wings remain tentative, as diﬀerent analyses of similar datasets provide inconsistent\\nresults. For example, Maiolino et al. (2012) and Cicone et al. (2015) reported a strong [C ii]\\noutﬂow in the host galaxy of the quasar J1148+5251 at z= 6.42. Meyer et al. (2022b),\\non the other hand, found no evidence of a broad velocity component but reported that\\nJ1148+5251 has the most spatially extended [C ii]emission (∼10 kpc) among z∼6 quasar\\nhosts. Izumi et al. (2021) report a broad ( ∼1000 km s−1) [Cii]wing in the spectrum of a\\nquasar atz= 7.07, and Khusanova et al. (2022) reported a tentative [C ii]broad component\\nthat could be as wide as ∼1400 km s−1in a BAL radio-loud quasar at z= 6.12. Bischetti\\net al. (2019) stacked the [C ii]spectra of 48 quasars at 4 .5<z< 7.1 and reported a broad\\n[Cii]component, while Decarli et al. (2018) stacked the [C ii]spectra of 23 z∼6 quasar\\nhosts and found no evidence for a [C ii]broad component. Novak et al. (2020) stacked\\nthe [C ii]spectra using diﬀerent techniques (spectral stacking and uv-plane stacking) and\\nfound no evidence for [C ii]broad-line emission. Novak et al. (2020) argued that the results\\ncan depend on the stacking techniques and resolution (e.g., if the resolution is low nearby\\ncompanions can be confused with [C ii]wings).\\nOH absorption. The hydroxyl molecule (OH) in absorption traces high-velocity molec-\\nular inﬂow or outﬂows (see review by Veilleux et al. 2020). Herrera-Camus et al. (2020)\\nreport the ﬁrst tentative detection (3 σ) of the OH 119 µm doublet in absorption towards a\\nz≳6 quasar, suggesting the presence of a molecular outﬂow. Outﬂow signatures from both\\natomic and molecular lines will be a focus of future high-quality ALMA observations.\\nJ0836+0054 at z=5.8J1030+0524 at z=6.3\\nFigure 11\\nThe twoz≳6 quasars with robust overdensities on ≳1 Mpc scales.

Protoclusters and Large Scale Structure\\nTheoretical models predict that z≳6 quasars should be highly biased tracers of the under-\\nlying dark matter distribution, signposting the ﬁrst overdensities of galaxies on Mpc scales,\\ni.e., protoclusters (e.g., Overzier et al. 2009, Costa et al. 2014; but some scatter is expected,\\nsee e.g., Ren et al. 2021). Observationally, this has been challenging to demonstrate. Photo-\\nmetric selection around high-redshift quasars has found evidence for overdensities (e.g., Ut-\\nsumi et al. 2010, Morselli et al. 2014), densities comparable to random ﬁelds (e.g., Ba˜ nados\\net al. 2013, Simpson et al. 2014, Mazzucchelli et al. 2017a), and even underdensities (e.g.,\\nKim et al. 2009).\\nThere are currently two z≳6 quasar ﬁelds with robust overdensities (i.e., including\\nspectroscopic conﬁrmation) on Mpc scales (Overzier 2022, Mignoli et al. 2020; see Fig. 11).\\nThese are SDSS J1030+0524 at z= 6.3 and SDSS J0836+0054 at z= 5.8. The works by\\nStiavelli et al. (2005), Kim et al. (2009), Simpson et al. (2014), Balmaverde et al. (2017),\\nDecarli et al. (2019b) were crucial for conﬁrming the overdense environment of J1030+0524.\\nSimilarly, Zheng et al. (2006), Ajiki et al. (2006), Bosman et al. (2020) were fundamental\\nfor conﬁrming the large-scale structure around J0836+0054. Recently, Yue et al. (2021a)\\nreport the ﬁrst quasar pair known at z∼6 (with a projected separation <10 kpc), implying\\na rich environment that still awaits conﬁrmation at larger scales.\\nALMA observations of z∼6 quasars hosts (see Section 5.2) have serendipitously de-\\ntected a population of [C ii]-bright companion galaxies in the immediate environment of\\n∼20-50% of the targeted quasars (Decarli et al. 2017, Neeleman et al. 2019, Venemans et al.\\n2020; see also bottom panel of Fig. 9). The large fraction of such quasar-galaxy pairs exceeds\\nby orders of magnitude the expectations based on the current constraints of the number\\ndensity of [C ii]-bright galaxies at these redshifts. Three out of ﬁve quasar companions with\\ndeep HST observations remain undetected (Mazzucchelli et al. 2019, Decarli et al. 2019a),\\nimplying a signiﬁcant part of a potential large-scale structure might be obscured. The two\\nHST-detected companions show tentative evidence of AGN activity (Connor et al. 2019,\\nVito et al. 2019b; but see also Vito et al. 2021).\\nThe ﬁeld of view of ALMA is too small to study whether these gas-rich companions exist\\nin large numbers over Mpc scales as predicted by simulations. MUSE observations of one of\\nthese quasar/companion ﬁelds reveal two additional LAEs in close proximity, strengthening\\nthe case for an overdensity (Meyer et al. 2022a). It is likely that the next leap on our\\nunderstanding of the environment of the highest-redshift quasars will come with JWST.\\nJWST deep imaging, multi-object, and slitless spectroscopy capabilities will provide a new\\nopportunity to probe the galaxy population in z≳6 quasar environments to unprecedented\\ndepth over the Mpc scales.\\n6. QUASARS AS PROBES OF COSMIC REIONIZATION\\nQuasars are both agents, and powerful probes of the cosmic reionization history. As rare but\\nluminous sources with hard ionizing spectra, they contribute to the overall photon budget\\ndriving reionization, together with stellar photons from galaxies. Absorption measured\\nin quasar spectra from foreground gas has yielded many of the most sensitive constraints\\non the density, ionization, and chemical enrichment of this tenuous intergalactic material.\\nWhile quasars’ utility as reionization probes has been understood since foundational work\\nby Gunn & Peterson (1965), it has taken 40-50 years for quasar surveys to uncover objects\\ndeep into the reionization epoch and fully exploit the information that their absorption\\n30 Fan et al.\\nspectra encode (Fan et al. 2006b).\\nWhile absorption studies have yielded many of the most precise constraints on the IGM\\nopacity and neutral hydrogen fraction, they are subject to limitations on both system-\\natic accuracy, and physical interpretation. These limitations arise from multiple sources,\\nbut the most signiﬁcant factors discussed below are (a) uncertainty in the quasar’s in-\\ntrinsic/unabsorbed spectral continuum, (b) the large on-resonance oscillator strength of\\nHiLyα, which leads to a wide gap in sensitivity between neutral fractions of XHi∼10−4\\n(where resonance absorption saturates) and ∼10−1(where damping wings appear), and\\n(c) computational challenges of simulating representative volumes with inhomogeneous and\\nrapidly evolving radiation ﬁelds.\\n6.1. AGN and the Ionizing Photon Budget\\nQuasar accretion produces a hard ionizing spectrum, making the AGN population a con-\\ntributing source to the budget of photons needed for reionization. However as detailed in\\nthe recent review by Robertson (2021) and references therein, there is an emerging con-\\nsensus that AGN play a subdominant role compared to galaxies as an overall driver of the\\nphase transition, even when one extrapolates observed luminosity functions to thresholds\\nfainter than current detection limits. Jiang et al. (2022) further reinforced this conclusion\\nby placing an upper limit on the contributions of low luminosity AGN to reionization us-\\ning deep HST survey data. Finkelstein & Bagley (2022) have synthesized measurements\\nacross the lierature of galaxy+AGN UV luminosity functions, to estimate their relative\\ncontributions to the ionizing photon budget, using strong assumptions about the ionizing\\nradiation escape fractions of each population. They estimate that AGN supply ∼10% of\\nthe total ionizing photon budget at z∼5, roughly the lower limit of redshifts considered in\\nour review. They found that this fraction drops rapidly toward higher redshift because of\\ndiﬀerential downward evolution in the quasar luminosity function relative to galaxies. By\\nz∼7 they estimate that AGN contribute only 0 .3−1.0% of all ionizing photons, declining\\nby yet another order of magnitude by z∼9. In contrast, Giallongo et al. (2019) suggested\\nthat AGN contributions to the UV background can still be signiﬁcant at z∼5.6 based on\\nX-ray selected objects.\\nThe quantitative uncertainties in these analyses are still considerable; Finkelstein et al.\\n(2019) found a 10 ×higher contribution from AGN at z∼7 using diﬀerent assumptions.\\nMuch of this may be attributed to uncertainties in the faint end slope of the quasar lu-\\nminosity function. Still, the qualitative picture that reionization is heavily dominated by\\nstar-forming galaxies appears to remain fairly robust with respect to these uncertainties.\\nThe fractional contribution of quasars and AGN increases toward lower redshift because of\\ntheir rapidly rising number densities, such that they are more likely to dominate the meta-\\ngalactic UV background in the at z <4 post-reionization universe. New surveys with the\\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and JWST should revolutionize this ﬁeld, providing\\nboth deep, near-IR color selected objects deep into the EoR, and also sensitive spectra to\\nconﬁrm the AGN nature of faint candidates and separate them from star-forming galaxies.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 31\\n0.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Flux     \\n     ï15ï10ï50R (Physical Mpc)ï10ï50xHI\\nIonization FrontDampingWingz ≳ 70.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Flux     \\n     ï15ï10ï50R (Physical Mpc)ï10ï50xHIProximity Zonez ∼ 6\\nBehind QSOFigure 12\\nObservable properties and interpretation of Proximity Zones (upper left) and Damping Wings\\n(upper right). In the simulation panel (bottom), each box represents the location of a background\\nquasar whose sightline extends to the left. Proximity zones are studied at z∼5.8−6.5 and\\nrepresent regions of enhanced ionization from the quasar in an already-ionized IGM. There is no\\nabsorption redward of the quasar’s Ly αemission line (marked with a gray shaded region), and a\\nregion of low optical depth extends Rp∼5−10 proper Mpc. Damping wings have only been\\ndetected at z≳7, and represent ionization fronts penetrating into an IGM with a O(∼0.1)\\nneutral fraction, shown with red color scale in the simulation. On-resonance absorption is\\nsaturated up to and very near the quasar’s emission redshift, and the oﬀ-resonance Damping\\nWing (shaded blue) extends redward of Ly αin the quasar’s rest frame. Constraints on the IGM\\nneutral fraction come from this blue shaded zone, as well as the very short run of unsaturated\\npixels between the QSO’s systemic redshift and the end of the proximity zone.\\n6.2. Neutral Hydrogen Absorption in the Diﬀuse IGM\\nThe optical depth from neutral Hydrogen in a matter-dominated universe (appropriate for\\nthe redshifts considered here) is:\\nτ(λobs) =πe2f12\\nmec(\\nc\\nH0Ω1/2\\nM∫z\\n0nHI(z)\\n(1 +z)5/2φ(c/[λ0(1 +z)])dz)\\n12.\\nThe leading fraction has units of cross section per unit frequency in terms of the dimension-\\nless oscillator strength f12, which is an atomic constant determined for each ion ( f12= 0.416\\nfor Lyα). The expression in brackets reﬂects a column density, i.e. an integral of the radial\\nline element, weighted by the H idensity ﬁeld. The function φ(ν) is a unity-normalized line\\nshape. It is typically approximated as a Voigt proﬁle, which consists of a deep Gaussian line\\ncore whose width is determined by internal velocities, convolved with a much wider but also\\nmuch weaker Lorentzian wing. This so-called “damping wing” arises from an energy-time\\nuncertainty in the Ly αtransition, leading to a small but non-zero absorption cross section\\nin the rest frame for photons far from the resonance wavelength λrest= 1215.67˚A. Equation\\n12 indicates that the optical depth at each observed wavelength λobscontains contributions\\n32 Fan et al.\\nfrom neutral hydrogen at every intervening foreground redshift.\\nHowever because φ(ν) is so sharply peaked around line resonance, the integral is almost\\nalways dominated by matter at the redshift where λobs/(1 +z) =λrest. Directly at this\\nresonance wavelength, the Ly αcross section is very large—roughly 4 ×10−14cm2. Moreover\\nthe mean baryonic density increases toward high redshift as\\n¯nH(z)∼Ωbρc\\nµmH(1 +z)3= 8.6×10−5(1 +z\\n7)3\\ncm−3, 13.\\nwhich increases both the total gas column density, and also the H irecombination rate,\\nfavoring a higher neutral gas fraction XHi. Collectively these lead to a very large Ly α\\noptical depth of τ∼105if the IGM is 100% neutral.\\nHowever, observations show τ=O(∼1) at 2<z < 4; the presence of transmitted ﬂux\\nimplies that the Ly αforest is only neutral at the XHi∼10−5level. The optical depth\\nincreases toward high redshift in tandem with the neutral fraction, but by the time the\\nneutral fraction reaches XHi∼10−4, the optical depth already exceeds τ > 5, at which\\npoint>99% of the background quasar’s light is absorbed. On-resonance line absorption\\nis simply too strong to provide useful measurements of the neutral fraction XHiabove this\\nvalue.\\nIn contrast, the atomic cross section for a photon with wavelength in the Lorentzian\\ndamping wing is suppressed by 5–6 orders of magnitude relative to the peak at line center—\\neven at small velocity oﬀsets (100–200 km s−1). The eponymous Damped Lyman Alpha\\n(DLA) phenomenon is therefore only seen in small, rare high-overdensity environments\\nwith large column densities ( NHI>1020) atz<5.\\nReionization is characterized by an increasing neutral fraction in the diﬀuse IGM, which\\neventually becomes strong enough to produce damping wings (Miralda-Escud´ e 1998). How-\\never these are convolved with on-resonance absorption from H iat other redshifts, with the\\nunique exception of the quasar’s immediate foreground, where the damping wing can extend\\nredward of the Ly αemission line.\\nBridging this gap between strong on-resonance absorption, whose measurements probe\\n10−6< X Hi<10−4, and weak oﬀ-resonance damping wings which only emerge at\\nXHi>10−1is a recurring theme for IGM measurements near the reionization epoch. On-\\nresonance measurements are most useful in regions of locally enhanced ionization or at lower\\nredshifts (z<6.3) toward the late stages of reionization. Damping wing measurements are\\nmost powerful at early times and higher neutral fractions seen for z > 7. Observational\\nconstraints are much less precise for the epochs in the range 6 .3<z< 6.8, when the neutral\\nfraction evolved from 0 .01% to 10%— the Ly αline absorption is saturated, but damping\\nwings have not yet emerged.\\n6.2.1. Numerical Simulations. Cosmological simulations play an essential role in interpret-\\ning the spectra of reionization-epoch quasars, and placing their associated transmission\\nmeasurements into a broader physical context. We refer the reader to an excellent recent\\nreview (Gnedin & Madau 2022) on theoretical and numerical reionization models for a\\ncomprehensive overview of key methods and simulation projects.\\nBrieﬂy, simulations must confront several intersecting challenges in the attempt to repro-\\nduce the quasar spectral observables summarized below, together with luminosity functions\\nof reionization-era galaxy populations. An idealized simulation should have:\\n•A large box ( L>100 cMpc) to cover many scale lengths of the galaxy-galaxy auto-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 33\\ncorrelation function, and to sample the rare high-density peaks that could plausibly\\nhostM > 109M⊙SMBHs.\\n•Suﬃcient spatial and mass resolution to model disk galaxies realistically and resolve\\nlow-mass halos that produce light and heavy elements, as well as small-scale features\\nin the Lyαforest and Lyman Limit systems that act as ionizing radiation sinks.\\n•Ray tracing of emergent radiation from individual galaxies, to account for spatial\\nvariations in the density and ionizing background, shadowing from optically thick\\nabsorbers, or the timing of reionization.\\n•Full and self-consistent coupling of radiation to hydrodynamics, to capture the eﬀect\\nof ionization heating, pressure smoothing and adiabatic cooling on the evolving den-\\nsity ﬁeld and ionization fraction. These will also impact the formation of subsequent\\nstars and galaxies.\\nComputational limits prevent practical simulations from meeting all four these requirements\\nsimultaneously, though rapid progress in recent years has allowed some groups to progress\\nfrom analytic or semi-numerical eﬀorts to meet two or even three of the above bullets in\\nsingle simulations. The Gnedin & Madau review contains a helpful classiﬁcation of leading\\nnumerical projects according to their box sizes, hydro prescriptions, treatment of the UV\\nbackground, and radiation-hydro coupling.\\nWhile most large-scale simulations focus on reproducing global reionization signals such\\nas the volume-averaged neutral fraction, a separate numerical toolkit has evolved speciﬁcally\\nto interpret observations of proximity zones (Sec 6.3.1) and damping wings (Sec 6.3.2)\\nproduced in the immediate foreground of luminous quasars.\\nThese investigations begin with global simulations of the reionization-era IGM, and in-\\ntroduce the eﬀect of a high-luminosity quasar by hand in the simulation volume. A large\\nparent simulation is searched for high-mass halos ( M≥1−2×1011M⊙) representative of\\nhosts where SMBHs are ﬁrst thought to form. A bright quasar is then inserted at the center\\nof the halo, emitting ionizing photons with a luminosity scaled to the absolute 1450 ˚A mag-\\nnitude of known quasars, and extrapolated to the Lyman edge using carefully constructed\\ntemplate SEDs. The simulation is then evolved forward to follow expansion of the ion-\\nization front or proximity zone into the IGM. Multiple sightlines are drawn through the\\nsimulation box, terminating at the quasar’s host halo, and simulated transmission spectra\\nare extracted using the density, temperature, ionization and velocity cubes.\\nThis methodology has been adapted by several groups to place joint constraints on\\nquasar lifetimes and the IGM neutral fraction at z >7 (Bolton et al. 2011, Keating et al.\\n2015, Davies et al. 2018b, Cen & Haiman 2000), and to estimate the ages of z∼6 quasars\\nfrom their proximity zone sizes (Eilers et al. 2017, Bolton & Haehnelt 2007, Chen & Gnedin\\n2021). In ionized proximity zones, the simulations can also be used to calibrate methods to\\nreconstruct the ﬂuctuating density ﬁeld near the central host (Chen et al. 2022).\\nEssentially the simulations are used to generate statistical realizations of the matter\\ndistribution around massive quasar host halos, capturing non-linear physics and scale-\\ndependent correlations in a way that analytic PDFs of the optical depth and/or excursion\\nset formalism cannot accomplish.\\nA completely separate class of simulations is beginning to address challenging questions\\nabout heavy element enrichment of the early IGM and CGM (Keating et al. 2016), for\\ncomparison with observation of heavy element absorption in z > 6 QSO spectra. These\\nsimulations rely on subgrid feedback prescriptions for metal production, which are then\\n34 Fan et al.\\ntransported with standard hydro treatments as at lower redshift. Translation from metal\\nabundances into observable column densities is more complicated than for HI, because the\\nionization balance of multi-level ions depends on the UV background at other, often harder\\nenergies than the Lyman edge. A notable early eﬀort in multi-frequency treatment of\\nan inhomogeneous background is the Technicolor Dawn simulation (Finlator et al. 2018),\\nwhich tracks 24 separate frequencies and measures ionization balances of C IV and Si IV\\nin thez > 5.5 universe, though with a much smaller box size ( L∼12 cMpc) than the\\naforementioned simulations designed to capture quasar host halos.\\n3 4 5 60.1110100\\nO’Meara et al.

Before the discovery of z≳6 quasars, the evolving\\nLyαforest optical depth, which gradually increases with z, had been measured extensively\\nat lower redshifts (Rauch et al. 1997, Becker et al. 2007) and interpreted as a product of\\nthe ¯n∝(1 +z)3density ﬁeld together with a smoothly evolving UV ionizing radiation\\nbackground (Becker & Bolton 2013). Early discoveries of z >6 SDSS quasars (Fan et al.\\n2001) led to a reexamination of underlying assumptions about smooth evolution in XHi\\napproaching reionization. In particular, deep medium-resolution spectroscopy of one of\\nvery ﬁrst such objects — SDSS J1030+0524 at z= 6.3 — revealed a region of Lya forest\\nabsorption consistent with zero ﬂux at wavelengths corresponding to 5 .95< z < 6.16\\n(Becker et al. 2001). This work has been interpreted as the ﬁrst detection of a robust Gunn-\\nPeterson absorption trough, and has been followed by many similar analyses to improve how\\nthe IGM opacity is quantiﬁed (Fan et al. 2006b, Yang et al. 2020a, Bosman et al. 2018,\\nEilers et al. 2018, Becker et al. 2007, Pentericci et al. 2002).\\nThe simplest absorption indicator from a conceptual standpoint is the Ly αopacity,\\nτ=−ln(I/I0), whereI0represents an estimate of the unabsorbed continuum ﬂux level.\\nDeeper spectra of SDSS J1030+0524 and many subsequently discovered objects consistently\\nuncover similar spans of total absorption in Ly αresonance line at z >6, implying a large\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 35\\nlower bound on τlimited only by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spectral data.\\nThis highlights an important challenge in such measurements: the physical information\\nis contained in measuring ﬂux that is notseen. The logarithmic nature of optical depth\\nmeans that even in spectra with SNR ∼100 one can measure limits of τ≳4 (per pixel) at\\nbest, and the zero points can be aﬀected by systematic errors in data reduction, including\\naccurate subtraction night sky emission and correction for telluric absorption. Comparison\\nof observations of the same quasars observed with diﬀerent instruments and reduced with\\ndiﬀerent pipelines indicate discrepancies at the 1–2% ﬂux level, for a mean transmitted ﬂux\\nof 0.5–1.0% at z∼6 (McGreer et al. 2011, Eilers et al. 2018).\\nAdditional dynamic range can often be achieved by observing Ly βor higher order\\ntransitions from the Lyman series. These have progressively decreasing oscillator strengths\\nand require correspondingly larger H icolumn to saturate, allowing access to larger values\\nofτ. This advantage is oﬀset by complications arising from unknown blending with Ly α\\nforest absorption at lower redshift, and uncertainty in extrapolating the intrinsic quasar\\ncontinuum from Ly αto Lyβ.\\nMeasurements of the Ly αopacity are always smoothed to suppress noise and minimize\\nthe eﬀect of diﬀering spectral dispersion and resolution among instruments used in the\\nobservations. Following Fan et al. (2006b), most early studies have used observationally-\\nmotivated redshift bins of ∆ z= 0.15 for ease of comparison, deﬁnining the ”eﬀective optical\\ndepth”τeﬀ=−ln⟨F⟩over the smoothing interval. More recent studies advocate for a\\nphysically-motivated bin size of 50 cMpc, because a constant redshift interval evolves by\\n∼40% in comoving length over 5 <z< 7 where such measurements are made (Eilers et al.\\n2018, Becker et al. 2015). The two values (∆ z= 0.15 and 50 cMpc) are comparable at\\nz∼7. Fig 13 (left panel) presents a recent summary of Ly αoptical depth measurements.\\nAverageτmeasurements are simply the ﬁrst moment of an underlying optical depth\\ndistribution, which contains richer information and has therefore been measured extensively\\nand presented as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of optical depth. Evolution of\\nthe CDF is characterized by three phases, again reﬂecting the logarithmic nature of the\\nmeasurements. At z∼5.0−5.3 the distribution is fairly narrow and centered around\\nτ∼2, corresponding to a Ly αforest with signiﬁcant ( ∼90%) absorption at line resonance,\\nbut not yet fully saturated. At 5 .5< z < 6.0 the CDF widens to span 2 < τ < 6, as an\\nincreasing number of smoothed windows exhibit saturated absorption (i.e. zero transmitted\\nﬂux or high τ), but many signiﬁcant transmission/low neutral fraction windows remain.\\nAbovez>6 it becomes increasingly rare to ﬁnd unsaturated windows with τ <4, and the\\ndistribution once again narrows because spectral SNR renders the τ >6 regime inaccessible.\\nSeveral groups have explored alternative ionization metrics that use counts of trans-\\nmission spikes in the Lya forest, motivated by the many challenges of measuring optical\\ndepths in realistic, heavily absorbed data. Garaldi et al. (2019) constructed distribution\\nfunctionsd2N/dLdz , capturing the density of spikes per cMpc and unit redshift, above a\\nthreshold line ﬂux. These can be counted in spectra of varying resolution and SNR using\\nsimilar techniques as are used for blind searches for metal absorption lines in quasar spectra.\\nTheir analysis indicates that, after accounting for instrumental broadening and noise which\\nsuppress the spike count in realistic observed 5 <z < 6 spectra by an order of magnitude,\\nthe observed spike counts are roughly consistent with their self-consistent simulations of\\nthe post-reionization IGM transmission. In the simulation boxes, transmission spikes arise\\nfrom regions that are under-dense in hydrogen and galaxies, but over-ionized relative to\\nexpectations from equilibrium with the average radiation ﬁeld, likely because of proximity\\n36 Fan et al.\\nto local ionizing sources.\\nAtz >6 one expects transmission spikes to be exceedingly rare, so the detection even\\nof single spikes implies the existence of early ionized cavities. Searches for spikes in high-\\nredshift spectra have yielded several detections at 6 <z < 6.3 that provide upper bounds\\non the local optical depth, complementing the lower bounds derived from measurements of\\nsaturated spectral regions (e.g., Yang et al. 2020a).\\nA very diﬀerent way to conceptualize reionization is as a rapid increase in the mean-\\nfree-path (mfp) of ionizing photons. Although this is physically equivalent to an increase\\nin the volume-averaged ionization fraction, this alternative framing allows a diﬀerent anal-\\nysis approach that does not require high-SNR measurements of localized pixels or spikes.\\nInstead, samples of quasar spectra are stacked after shifting into the rest frame. Then a low-\\ndimensional parametric model is ﬁt to the shape of the stacked spectrum below the Lyman\\nlimit at 912 ˚A, corresponding to a probabilistic ﬂight length of ionizing photons traveling\\nfrom the quasar toward Earth. This model was originally developed at lower redshift to\\nstudy the evolution of the ionizing background far from the background quasar. At high\\nredshift, additional complexity must be added to the model to account for local ionization\\neﬀects near the quasar, since the mean free path can approach the length scale of proximity\\nzones of enhanced ionization around the quasar.\\nFig 13 (right panel) presents the measurements of IGM mpfp using the most recent\\nstacking analyses from Becker et al. (2021). It suggests a rapid change in the mean free\\npath from 8−10 pMpc at z= 5.1 to 0.75−1.5 pMpc atz= 6.0 (the range reﬂects poten-\\ntial ﬂuctuations from cosmic variance/sample size, and also uncertainty in the correlation\\nbetween the H iopacity and ionization rate). This evolution is much stronger than would\\nbe inferred from extrapolation of the evolving mfp at lower redshifts, as one would expect\\nin the late stages of a phase transition like reionization.\\n6.2.3. Dark Gaps and the late stages of reionization. The inverse phenomenon of Ly α\\ntransmission spikes—which trace the ﬁrst environments to complete reionization at z>6—\\nseveral quasar sightlines exhibit long, dark gaps of zero ﬂux at z <6. These gaps are now\\nunderstood to represent residual islands of neutral matter during late-stage reionization.\\nAs ﬁrst explored by Becker et al. (2015) after the discovery of a >110 cMpc dark span\\ntowards the quasar ULAS J0148+0600, measurements of gap length have the advantage of\\nbeing relatively insensitive to the details of estimating the quasar continuum, or absolute\\nﬂux levels. Long gaps are not seen at z∼5, and indeed recent work by Zhu et al. (2021)\\nﬁnds that 90% of quasar spectra at z∼6 have a dark gap of 30 cMpc or longer, but only\\n15% do atz= 5.6.\\nGap statistics have generated signiﬁcant theoretical interest, as they appear to be incon-\\nsistent with numerical models approximating the ionizing UV background ﬁeld as spatially\\nuniform atz= 5.5−6 (Zhu et al. 2021). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain\\nthe phenomenon, including (a) upward ﬂuctuations in gas density (yielding a higher recom-\\nbination rate and neutral fraction), (b) downward ﬂuctuations in the ionizing radiation\\nbackground, or (c) upward ﬂuctuations in galaxy number density, leading to lower-than-\\naverage temperatures (D’Aloisio et al. 2015). The latter scenario is less intuitive, arising\\nfrom a subtle eﬀect where regions of high galaxy density reionize early, and then have more\\ntime to cool oﬀ from the associated photoionization heating. These ﬁrst areas to reionize\\nhave a lower temperature than surrounding regions that reionize later and have not yet\\ncooled. Because the H irecombination rate scales as T−0.7, cooler regions that reionized\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 37\\nearliest would have higher neutral fraction and opacity characteristic of dark gaps.\\nThis yields a testable prediction to distinguish between dark gap models arising from UV\\nbackground versus temperature-driven ﬂuctuations (Davies et al. 2018a). Galaxy surveys\\nalong sightlines with gaps should see an enhancement in galaxy counts relative to the ﬁeld\\nif the gaps arise in cool regions that reionized early; conversely there should be a galaxy\\ndeﬁcit if the gaps arise in islands of enhanced neutral fraction and/or low ionizing radiation\\nbackground (two eﬀects which are not straightforward to distinguish). Christenson et al.\\n(2021), Becker et al. (2018), and Ishimoto et al. (2022) conducted narrowband Lya surveys in\\nﬁelds centered on well-known dark gaps to test this prediction, and found an underdensity of\\nLyman-alpha emitters within 20 h−1Mpc of the quasar sightline, favoring a scenario where\\nthe dark gaps represent residual neutral islands persisting in the late-reionization universe.\\nSpectroscopic galaxy surveys have been diﬃcult and expensive at these redshifts from the\\nground, but early observations with JWST indicate that prospects are very favorable for\\ncorrelating galaxies observed in rest-frame optical emission lines with the IGM Lya opacity.\\nOverall, a consistent picture emerges from a suite of distinct IGM observations using\\nquasar spectra, including (a) the average Ly αoptical depth and its CDF, (b) dark gaps, (c)\\ntransmission spikes, and (d) the mean free path. The ﬁrst three of these four measurements\\nresult from on-resonance Ly αabsorption and the fourth measures the Lyman continuum,\\nmaking them all most useful toward the tail end of reionization at 5 .5<z< 6.3, when the\\nvolume-averaged neutral fraction is ∼10−4, but with signiﬁcant spatial ﬂuctuations. Taken\\ntogether there is evidence that large neutral islands persisted well after z∼6, possibly in\\nregions of low galaxy density and ambient ionizing radiation. During this time there was a\\ntenfold increase in the mean free path for ionizing photons, eventually reaching cosmological\\nlength scales of 10 pMpc or more. The earliest regions to fully reionize can be traced by\\ntransmission spikes at z∼6.3, and are likely to reside in regions of low gas density that\\nhappen by chance to fall near a source of ionizing radiation.\\n6.2.4. Thermal signatures. Ionizing sources emit a spectrum of radiation including photons\\nwith energy above the E > 13.6 eV Hydrogen ionization potential. The excess photon\\nenergy heats the post-reionization IGM, which subsequently cools over time due to adiabatic\\ncosmic expansion. Such heating and cooling is clearly seen during the reionization of He ii\\nat lower redshift (Walther et al. 2019); an even larger eﬀect should be present for Hydrogen\\nreionization. Unfortunately unlike He ii, it is not possible to measure heating from Hydrogen\\nreionization in “real time”, because Gunn-Peterson absorption fully blankets the signal at\\nthe redshifts of interest. Nevertheless the temperature of the IGM at lower redshift—after\\nreionization is complete—still encodes information about the past thermal history.\\nHigh-resolution quasar spectra are excellent thermometers of the IGM, because thermal\\ngas motions projected along the line of sight smooth or broaden absorption features. At\\nlower redshifts where individual unblended lines can be resolved in the Ly αforest, tempera-\\nture maps directly to line proﬁle width through the Voigt proﬁle parameter b=√\\n2kT/m ion,\\nthough this signature is convolved with similar broadening from turbulence and bulk gas\\nmotions.\\nAtz >4.5 it becomes impossible to distinguish individual lines, so the IGM’s temper-\\nature signal must be measured statistically. Eﬀectively, thermal eﬀects impose a low-pass\\nﬁlter on the power spectrum, smoothing out small scale structure in the pattern of Ly α\\ntransmission. The band limit of this ﬁlter is a partly a proxy for the instantaneous tem-\\nperature, but it also retains a memory of past heating, which is partly manifested through\\n38 Fan et al.\\na pressure (i.e. Jeans) broadening beyond the normal Hubble ﬂow. These eﬀects are cali-\\nbrated by statistical comparison to cosmological simulations.\\nThe simulations are generally run on a grid which varies the mean temperature of the\\nIGM at speciﬁed redshifts T0(z), the slope γof the IGM’s temperature-density relation\\nT(∆) =T0∆γ−1, and the thermal energy injected into the IGM during reionization u0,\\nin units of eV per baryon. Synthetic spectra are drawn directly from simulation volumes\\nand run through identical analysis software as the true quasar spectra, to ascertain which\\ncombination of T0,γandu0produce 1D ﬂux power spectra most closely matching observed\\nvalues.\\nUsing these methods, Boera et al. (2019) ﬁnd IGM temperatures of T0= 7000−8000\\nK at 4.2<z < 5.0, which is where the eﬀective optical depth of the forest is 1 <τeﬀ<2,\\nmaking the method most sensitive. Toward higher redshifts where Gunn-Peterson satura-\\ntion begins to manifest, thermal measurements become increasingly challenging. However\\nrecent constraints have been extracted by ﬁtting the widths of emission line spikes, indi-\\ncating slightly higher T0= 10,000−12,000K at earlier times z= 5.3−5.9 as expected\\naccording to the paradigm of heating and adiabatic cooling (Gaikwad et al. 2020).\\nThe simulations can also explore a range of diﬀerent reionization histories to see which\\nparameters best reproduce the post-reionization power spectrum. Toy models of instan-\\ntaneous reionization provide joint constraints on the redshift of thermal injection and its\\namplitude, favoring z∼8−10 as the reionization redshift, and peak post-reionization\\ntemperatures of T= 10,000−20,000 K depending on the choice of ionizing background\\nspectrum. Temperature constraints on the reionization history are limited because the\\nIGM tends to rapidly cool back to its ionization equilibrium temperature, washing out the\\nsignal from the initial thermal impulse. As mentioned above, the rapid thermal broaden-\\ning is accompanied by a pressure broadening that also manifests in the power spectrum,\\nand is somewhat longer lived. It is not possible to fully disentangle pressure and tem-\\nperature smoothing eﬀects from line-of-sight measurements. However measurements made\\nusing pairs of adjacent quasar sightlines can break this degeneracy, since they only measure\\nsmoothing on a transverse spatial scale by construction (Rorai et al. 2017).\\nSummarizing, while the power spectrum and thermal history cannot provide precision\\nconstraints on the timing of hydrogen reionization, it supports a general result that by\\nz∼5, the initial thermal energy injected into the IGM has already cooled substantially, by\\nperhaps a factor of 2 −3. This sets a lower bound on the elapsed time between the period\\nof thermal energy injection and z∼4−5 where the measurements are made. This in turn\\nimplies that the peak heating associated with reionization occurred at 7 <z< 10, broadly\\nconsistent with CMB results reported by Planck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020).\\n6.3. Neutral Hydrogen Absorption in the Quasar Environment\\nEach quasar spectrum oﬀers the opportunity to study radiative feedback in the neighbor-\\nhood of a luminous source of ionizing photons: the background object itself. At 2 <z< 3, a\\nclear deﬁcit is seen in the density of Lyman alpha forest lines as a quasar’s emission redshift\\nis approached (Murdoch et al. 1986, Bajtlik et al. 1988). For these lower redshifts where\\nthe ambient IGM is clearly optically thin, the so-called “proximity eﬀect” reﬂects a local\\nenhancement of ionization in an already highly-ionized medium, and can be used to derive\\nestimates of the quasar’s ionizing ﬂux over the metagalactic background.\\nThis measurement becomes increasingly valuable at high redshift, because the diﬀuse\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 39\\nFigure 14\\nThe size distribution of proximity zones at 5 .9<z< 6.4 (Eilers et al. 2021), versus their host\\nquasar’s absolute magnitude or luminosity.

This\\nmatches a representative sample of quasars at these redshifts (gray points), but separate samples\\nhave been identiﬁed with small proximity zones that have been interpreted as evidence of recent\\nUV accretion episodes.\\nIGM is optically thick to Ly αabsorption. However the observational manifestation of inter-\\nactions between quasar radiation and the IGM diﬀers according to whether the surrounding\\nmedium has already undergone reionization — in which case one observes a “proximity\\nzone” — or the surrounding medium still has a high neutral fraction — in which case one\\nobserves a damping wing. Both phenomena are now well established; in the sections below\\nwe aim to clarify the distinction between the two, reconcile some diﬀerences in deﬁnitions,\\nand clarify at which redshifts each one is most powerful.\\n6.3.1. Proximity zones and the eﬀects of quasar radiation on recently reionized matter.\\nAtzem∼5.9−6.5, on-resonance (Gunn-Peterson) Ly αhas suﬃcient column density to fully\\nabsorb a quasar’s continuum. However the volume-averaged neutral fraction is only ∼10−4\\nduring late-stage reionization, so a quasar’s local ionization boost can suppress the local\\nLyαopacity to optically thin values τ <1, allowing some ﬂux to transmit at wavelengths\\njust blueward of the Ly αemission line. In exact analogy to the classic proximity eﬀect at\\nlower redshift, these “proximity zones” at z∼6 trace a local ionization enhancement in\\nan already ionized medium. They should not be confused with Str¨ omgren spheres, because\\nthe outside medium has a neutral fraction XHi≪1.\\nThe size of a quasar’s proximity zone depends on its ionizing photon luminosity, its\\nlifetime (i.e. how long it has been shining in a UV-bright phase), and the density and\\n40 Fan et al.\\nionization of the surrounding medium. By convention, observers have deﬁned the proximity\\nzone as the total path from zemto where a quasar’s spectral ﬂux density remains >10%\\nof the continuum level, after smoothing by a boxcar window of width 20 ˚A (Fan et al.\\n2006b). While observationally convenient and consistent, this deﬁnition is not motivated\\nby any physical transition or process. It is loosely related to a radius of enhanced ionizing\\nbackground, but at a 10% ﬂux threshold the enhancement is still very strong — the quasar\\ncontribution exceeds the ambient ﬁeld by an order of magnitude (Eilers et al. 2017). In\\nselect cases one may compare Ly αand Lyβmeasurements to improve dynamic range in\\nanalogous fashion to IGM measurements (Mesinger & Haiman 2004). In this case, one is\\nprobing the sharpness of the boundary of enhanced ionization fraction.\\nUniformly selected samples have yielded typical proximity zone sizes of 2–6 pMpc, with\\na strong (expected) dependence on quasar luminosity, and comparatively weak dependence\\non redshift between 6 .0< z < 6.5 (Eilers et al. 2017, 2020). Intriguingly, after adjusting\\nproximity zone sizes to normalize out the eﬀect of quasar luminosity, Eilers et al. (2017)\\nfound that∼10% of their sample had exceptionally small proximity zones. They argued\\nthat the most likely explanation is that we are observing these quasars before their radiation\\nﬁeld has reached ionization equilibrium with the surrounding IGM, i.e. their current UV-\\nluminous period is t <100,000 years old, with extreme objects even at t <10,000 years\\n(Eilers et al. 2021). Stacking analysis of multiple quasars’ near zones indicates that the\\nmedian quasar lifetime is larger by approximately an order of magnitude (Morey et al.\\n2021). Fig 14 presents a summary of proximity zone size measurements, along with “young\\nquasars” identiﬁed through this type of measurement.\\nIf this interpretation is correct, then proximity zone size distributions can be used to\\nconstrain the UV duty cycle of early quasars. The size is sensitive only to the age of the most\\nrecent or current UV-bright episode, which is not necessarily the ﬁrst in its history. However\\nthe growth timescale problem for building SMBHs at z >6 is well known (see Sec 4; and\\nVolonteri 2010), and this challenge is only exacerbated for any accretion duty cycle below\\nunity. It may be that the usual assumed correspondence between robust accretion and\\nUV-bright episodes may need revision, and signiﬁcant black hole growth can occur during\\na dusty, obscured phase.\\n6.3.2. IGM Damping Wings. As one penetrates deeper into the reionization epoch near\\nz∼7, the ambient neutral fraction increases and the corresponding length scale of proximity\\nzones becomes smaller. When the neutral fraction approaches 1–10%, the eﬀects of oﬀ-\\nresonance Ly αdamping wings become signiﬁcant (Miralda-Escud´ e 1998). Details of this\\nprocess have been reviewed in Mortlock (2016). Brieﬂy, high column densities of neutral\\nhydrogen in the nearby foreground of a quasar lead to a non-negligible probability that a\\nphoton emitted redward of Ly αin the quasar’s rest frame will still be absorbed by neutral\\nintergalactic matter en route to Earth. This last fact is critical—in the far-foreground Ly α\\nforest region there is an unresolvable degeneracy at any wavelength between oﬀ-resonance\\ndamping wing absorption from neutral gas, and on-resonance absorption from ionized gas\\nat a diﬀerent redshift. In contrast, absorption redward of the Ly αemission line can only\\ncome from oﬀ-resonance interactions.\\nThe IGM damping signature is expected around quasars meeting two conditions: they\\nhave recently turned on, and are embedded in an IGM with high global neutral fraction.\\nIn contrast to z∼6 proximity zones that have already been pre-ionized by surrounding\\ngalaxies, the z∼7 quasars with damping wings are driving true ionization fronts into the\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 41\\nFigure 15\\nDamping wing measurements for J0252-0503 ( z= 7.00).

(2022).\\nsurrounding IGM with a size that increases with the quasar’s active phase lifetime and\\nionizing photon ﬂux, and decreases with larger overdensity.\\nThe strength of a damping wing is most sensitive to the neutral fraction of matter just\\noutside the quasar’s ionization front. Gas closer to the quasar is inside the ionization front,\\nso its neutral fraction is too low to produce oﬀ-resonance Ly αabsorption wings. Gas that\\nis far outside the ionization front can produce oﬀ-resonance absorption, but its line-of-sight\\nvelocity oﬀset is too large for the oﬀ-resonance wing to produce appreciable optical depth\\nredward of Lya emission.\\nDamping wing measurements are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by systematic uncertainties in\\nmodeling the detailed shape of quasars’ intrinsic Ly αproﬁle. Diﬀerent groups have tackled\\nthis challenge using training sets of low-redshift SDSS or HST/COS spectra where the Ly α\\nemission proﬁle and unabsorbed continuum can be estimated more reliably. The objective\\nis to predict the unabsorbed Ly αemission line shape and forest continuum (and associated\\nuncertainties) using pixels to the red of the quasar’s Ly αemission line.\\nMultiple groups have used Principal Component Analysis (Davies et al. 2018c, Mort-\\nlock et al. 2011), Machine/Deep Learning models (Liu & Bordoloi 2021), Neural Networks\\n(ˇDurovˇ c´ ıkov´ a et al. 2020), covariance matrices (Greig et al. 2017, 2022), stacking of nearest-\\nneighbor observed spectra (Simcoe et al. 2012, Bosman & Becker 2015, Bosman et al. 2021),\\nor other hybrid approaches to train and validate continuum+Ly αsoftware on lower redshift\\nquasars. Most methods also calculate some envelope of formal uncertainty on the contin-\\nuum estimate before applying them to z∼7 quasar spectra. When comparing diﬀerent\\nreconstruction techniques in the Ly α/Lyβforest region and around the Ly αemission line,\\nthe diﬀerence between continuum models for the same object using diﬀerent codes often\\nexceeds expectations from their formal error estimates, indicating the presence of residual\\nsystematics. It has therefore been important to test observations of the same objects taken\\n42 Fan et al.\\nusing diﬀerent instruments and analysis software to build conﬁdence in the fundamental\\nconclusion about damping wing strengths and the neutral fraction. Fig 15 illustrates some\\nof the diﬀerent techniques in predicting the quasar intrinsic spectrum in the damping wing\\nregion of a quasar at z= 7.0.\\nWhile it is impossible to know if any particular continuum realization is “correct”, a con-\\nsensus is indeed emerging that certain speciﬁc objects — most notably ULASJ1342+0928\\n(z= 7.54; Ba˜ nados et al. 2018), DESJ0252 −0503 (z= 7.00; Wang et al. 2020), J1007+2115\\n(z= 7.51; Yang et al. 2020b) and ULASJ1120+0641 ( z= 7.09; Mortlock et al. 2011) —\\nshow strong evidence for IGM damping wings for all continuum models explored in the\\nliterature. Various analyses derive slightly diﬀerent IGM neutral fractions for the same\\nobjects on account of modeling diﬀerences (Greig et al. 2022, 2019, Davies et al. 2018b,\\nBolton et al. 2011). But a robust result remains that 67% of known quasars at z > 7\\nhave (a) negligible proximity zone sizes, and (b) ﬂux measurements at wavelengths slightly\\nredder than the Lya emission line that fall below all continuum reconstructions based on\\nlow-redshift quasars. This combination of small proximity zone and damping wing has not\\nbeen measured in a single quasar at z <7, despite the much larger sample sizes available\\nfor testing.\\nBecause most of the damping wing is generated just outside the ionized bubble, there\\nis a risk that the same signature could arise from chance alignment of a classical damped\\nLyαabsorber (i.e. from the ISM of a bound proto-galaxy) near the quasar in an otherwise\\nionized IGM (Section 6.5). Indeed there are examples of such “proximate DLAs” in the\\nliterature, including several at z > 6. The a priori odds of such a chance alignment are\\nsmall, but were considered carefully in studies of the ﬁrst damping wing (Simcoe et al.\\n2012). There are two arguments now suggesting that this phenomenon is not aﬀecting IGM\\nmeasurements at z>7. First, none of the four sightlines listed above exhibit heavy-element\\nabsorption at the redshift of the putative DLA, to very sensitive limits. Second, the presence\\nof damping wings in multiple new z>7 discoveries points to a global phenomenon, as the\\njoint probability of seeing proximate DLAs in all of these becomes lower still. With very\\nhigh-SNR data it is in principle possible to distinguish between DLA absorption from the\\ncondensed CGM/ISM of a proto-galaxy and an extended patch of neutral but gravitationally\\nunbound IGM using the damping proﬁle alone. However no studies at present have claimed\\nsuch a detection.\\nA ﬁnal unknowable factor in damping wing analysis is the spatial distribution of gas\\ndensity and accompanying ﬂuctuations in ionization inside and outside the proximity zone.\\nEarly papers used analytic models based on distribution functions of overdensity, and as-\\nsumed that the gas was in ionization equilibrium with a uniform background radiation ﬁeld\\n(Mortlock et al. 2011, Simcoe et al. 2012). Later and more sophisticated treatments have\\ndrawn distributions of sightlines from cosmological simulations to capture the line-of-sight\\nvariations in density and ionization (Greig et al. 2019). Large simulation boxes are required\\nfor this method, to identify the rare, high-mass halos where early quasars are thought to\\nreside. Many sightlines are constructed which terminate by design at the high-mass halo,\\nto generate many realizations of the damping wing for diﬀerent viewing orientations.\\nSummarizing, among all quasar absorption methods, IGM damping wings yield the\\nonly two-sided constraint on XHiatz >5.7, and are therefore one of our most important\\nprobes of reionization history. They are nevertheless subject to substantial, and probably\\nunresolvable systematic uncertainties concerning quasar continuum shape and details of the\\ndensity and ionization ﬁelds around each quasar. Nevertheless a tentative consensus has\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 43\\n0.20.40.60.81.0\\nLyα+β Dark Pixels\\nMcGreer+2015\\nJin+2022\\nQuasar Damping Wings\\nGreig+2017\\nBañados+2018\\nDavies+2018\\nGreig+2019Wang+2020\\nYang+2020b\\nGreig+2022\\nReionization History\\nPlanck 2018 (FlexKnot Model)\\nRobertson et al., 2015\\nFinkelstein et al., 2019\\nNaidu et al., 2020Dark Gaps\\nLyα+β\\n(Zhu+2022)\\n5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5\\nRedshift z10-510-410-310-2\\nIGM Neutral Hydrogen Fraction xHILyα Forest τeff\\nFan+2006\\nYang+2020a\\nBosman+2021Figure 16\\nSummary of quasar absorption constraints on the reionization history (all data points; Figure\\nadapted from Jin et al. 2022).

Heavy Element Enrichment of Intervening Quasar Absorbers\\nThe radiative feedback that drove reionization was accompanied by chemical feedback that\\ncan also be observed in the spectra of high redshift quasars. At z > 6, large samples of\\nhigh-resolution quasar spectra taken with VLT/XShooter, Magellan/FIRE, Keck/NIRES\\nand Gemini/GNIRS have revealed foreground heavy element absorption lines redward of\\n44 Fan et al.\\nLyαwhere the quasar’s continuum can be easily modeled. Because H iis saturated in the\\nLyαforest atz >6, metal absorption lines provide the only accessible information about\\ndiﬀuse gas at these epochs.\\nAbsorption strength in these papers is sometimes reported as column density Nionand\\nother times as a rest-frame equivalent width Wr. The IR spectrographs listed above have\\nintrinsic resolutions of ∆ v∼50 km/s or coarser, which is insuﬃcient to resolve the ﬁne\\n5−10 km/s velocity structure seen in metal-line absorbers at lower redshift. Equivalent\\nwidth measurements are therefore conservative and will be consistently measured across all\\nspectrographs. Column densities are easier to interpret physically, but must be approached\\nwith care, accounting for the possibility of unresolved saturation in the line core, or blend-\\ning of unresolved components.

Deeper spectra or statistical stacks will be needed to search for metals in the diﬀuse\\nIGM.\\nEarly studies of heavy element enrichment in the reionization epoch (Simcoe et al. 2011,\\nD’Odorico et al. 2013, Ryan-Weber et al. 2006, Becker et al. 2009, Simcoe 2006) focused\\non the C ivdoublet, which is the most ubiquitous IGM metal line at lower redshifts and a\\ntracer of highly-ionized circumgalactic gas.

For example, Codoreanu et al. (2018) surveyed deep spec-\\ntra of four quasar sightlines, ﬁnding a four-fold decrease in comoving line density dN/dX\\nbetweenz= 4.8 andz= 5.7, and zero detections above z > 6, consistent with earlier\\nbut smaller studies in the literature (Simcoe et al. 2011). There is very tentative evidence\\nof a steepening in the column density distribution function (CDDF) f(N) =d2N/dNdX ,\\nbecause of diﬀerential evolution of the strongest C ivabsorbers at high redshift. However\\nthese analyses still utilize modest numbers of sightlines ( <10), so shot noise and saturation\\nbecome signiﬁcant limitations at the high- Wrend. There are now relatively large samples\\nof high quality spectra for z>6.5 quasars, which should lead to improved estimates of the\\nCDDF and C ivevolution in the near future.\\nEvolving enrichment levels are sometimes summarized in terms of the C ivcontribu-\\ntion to closure density Ω CIV, which is a mass-weighted integral of the CDDF. Like dN/dX\\nor the normalization of f(N), Ω CIVdeclines toward higher redshift. While it is conve-\\nnient to express global metal enrichment in terms of this single number, the power-law\\nslopef(N)∝N−1.5of the CDDF is shallower than α=−2, implying that the integral∫\\nNf(N)dNdiverges toward high column densities. The single strongest absorber in any\\nsample therefore dominates the integral, meaning that by construction Ω CIVis aﬀected by\\nshot noise and pathlength searched.\\nThe disappearance of C ivat high redshift could be driven either by a decline in heavy\\nelement abundances, or by a change in ionization. If abundance evolution predominates one\\n1The quantity dX=dz√\\nΩM(1 +z)3+ ΩΛis equivalent to a redshift path at z= 0, but accounts\\nfor pure cosmological evolution in the comoving radial line element. A population of absorbers with\\nconstant product n(z)σof comoving space density n(z) and absorption cross section σwill have a\\nconstantdN/dX at all redshifts.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 45\\nFigure 17\\n(Left) Evolution in number density dN/dX of heavy element absorption systems, illustrating the\\ndiﬀerent behavior between highly ionized species C ivand SiIV, which decline with increasing\\nredshift, and low-ionization species Mg iiand OI, which do not decline. (Right) A stack of z>5.7\\nabsorbers selected individually by MgII detection, which shows other low-ionization lines, but no\\nevidence of C ivor SiIV.\\nmight also expect to see a decline in the frequency of low-ionization species such as Mg ii,\\nOI, SiII, CII, or FeII. However there have been robust detections of all these low-ionization\\nlines atz >6, suggesting an important change in the ionization state of metal absorption\\nline systems coincident with the reionization of intergalactic hydrogen.\\nThe ﬁrst detections of low-ionization metal absorption at z > 6 focused on the OI\\n1302, CII 1334, and SiII 1260 lines, which have rest wavelengths only slightly to the red of\\nLyαand can therefore be detected in high-resolution optical (rather than infrared) spectra\\n(Becker et al. 2011). However the small oﬀset between these and Ly αalso leaves a very\\nshort search pathlength per sightline; if they are too far in the quasar’s foreground these\\nlines fall within the H iGunn-Peterson trough and become impossible to detect.\\nWith improved IR spectra it became possible to search systematically for low-ionization\\nMgiidoublets at z >6, albeit with complex selection windows caused by broadband at-\\nmospheric absorption between the J/H andH/K bands, discrete telluric absorption, and\\nbright hydroxyl emission lines. After accounting for these eﬀects, Mg iisurveys ﬁnd trends\\nconsistent with the other neutral ions—there is no clear evolution in the comoving line den-\\nsitydN/dX for systems with Wr>0.3˚A (although if one restricts to very strong absorbers,\\nthere is a slight excess at z∼3; Chen et al. 2017, Matejek & Simcoe 2012). Mg iiabsorbers\\nare now detected out to the highest known redshift of an absorption system, at z= 6.84\\n(Simcoe et al. 2020).\\nThe statistical decrease in C ivfrequency together with statistical non-evolution of low-\\nionization species requires that as reionization is approached, one should eventually ﬁnd\\nindividual absorbers with CII, OI, SiII, and Mg iibut no detection of a highly ionized C iv\\n46 Fan et al.\\nphase. This is indeed the case; in fact such low-ionization-only systems predominate at\\nz>6, composing over 2/3 of all metal line absorbers (Cooper et al. 2019).\\nIn sharp contrast, “low-ionization only” absorbers are exceedingly rare at all redshifts\\nz < 5.5, indicating a qualitative change in the CGM’s observable properties during the\\nreionization epoch. At 2 < z < 4 OI, CII, and SiII are much more rare than C iv; nearly\\nevery known low-ionization absorber is accompanied by stronger C ivand SiIV lines oﬀset by\\n<100 km/s, and there are many examples of C ivwith no low-ionization lines (Cooper et al.\\n2019). Because absorption surveys are cross-section selected, the canonical interpretation is\\nthat ionized C ivtraces a widespread low-density CGM, while OI, CII, and SiII trace cooled\\nand condensed clumps in the ISM of a nearby galaxy, or small, cold precipitates embedded\\nin the warm ionized CGM (Stern et al. 2016). The evolution of the number density of heavy\\nelement absorption systems is summarized in Fig 17.\\nThe observational disappearance of the ionized CGM implies that during this epoch\\nwhere galaxies are in early assembly, their circumgalactic gas has not yet been enriched to\\nobservable levels, and/or the ambient radiation ﬁeld is insuﬃcient in intensity or hardness to\\nmaintain a high degree of ionization. Unfortunately it is impossible to calculate abundances\\ndirectly at z > 6, because H icolumn density measurement is prevented by the Gunn-\\nPeterson trough. However the number density of these low-ionization metal lines is similar\\nto extrapolations of dN/dX for DLAs and sub-DLAs (Cooper et al. 2019, Becker et al.\\n2019) and is either ﬂat or slightly increasing at earlier times. If one assumes H icolumn\\ndensities in this range ( NHI>1019.8), the detected low-ionization lines are consistent with\\na metallicity of [C/H] ∼−2.3, in a warm neutral medium. If there exists a warm ionized\\nmedium of similar metallicity in pressure equilibrium with the warm neutral phase, it would\\nbe clearly detected in C iv. To evade detection, the ionized medium must have ∼100×lower\\nabundance, or [C/H] <−4 (Simcoe et al. 2020). If the heavy elements seen in low ionization\\nlines are produced locally to that environment, this implies that those metals have not yet\\nbeen mixed into the ionized CGM. Evidently the galactic environments traced by z > 6\\nmetal absorbers bear some resemblance to metal-poor DLAs at lower redshifts, but they\\nare at an early and immature stage of chemical evolution and mixing.\\n6.5. Metal Absorption in the Vicinity of QSO Hosts\\nAt all redshifts one can ﬁnd a rare but important class of metal absorbers in the immediate\\nforeground of their respective quasar hosts (Prochaska et al. 2008). These “proximate\\nDLAs” have a special importance, and four have been discovered at z >6. They are the\\nonly discrete absorbers in the reionization epoch for which it is possible to constrain NHI\\ndirectly using the oﬀ-resonance wing. Because DLAs with NHI>1020.3cm−3are self-\\nshielded and largely neutral, the pDLAs therefore also permit direct measurement of heavy\\nelement abundances, with no ionization correction needed.\\nThe pDLAs are distinguished from IGM damping wings on the basis of coincident metal\\nabsorption. They are also found at lower redshift than the four z >7 IGM damping wing\\ncandidates—two pDLAs are at z∼6.3−6.4 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2019b, Andika et al. 2022), one\\natz∼6 (Davies 2020), and one is at z= 5.93, 40 kpc from a galaxy detected with ALMA\\nat coincident redshift (D’Odorico et al. 2018). At these redshifts no other quasars have\\nexhibited metal-free damping wings, and many observations of transmission spikes indicate\\nthat reionization is well underway (Yang et al. 2020a).\\nThe pDLAs studied by Ba˜ nados et al. (2019b) and D’Odorico et al. (2018) have abun-\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 47\\ndances near 0 .001Z⊙, which would place them amongst the most metal poor DLAs known\\nat lower redshift (Cooke et al. 2011). Neither shows evidence for anomalies in relative\\nabundances, as might be expected from a medium enriched with Population III supernova\\ndebris. High ionization C ivand SiIV are not reported in either system, consistent with\\nthe discussion in the previous section about the disappearance of the high-ionization CGM\\nphase. This has been cited as evidence that the pDLA originates outside of the quasar\\nhost, where the UV radiation ﬁeld should be enhanced and an ionized medium would be\\nexpected.\\nThe evidence so far suggests that pDLAs in the reionization epoch are representative\\nof randomly intervening metal absorbers at similar redshift.\\n7. Summary\\nSince the ﬁrst discoveries of reionization-era quasars more than twenty years ago, tremen-\\ndous progress has been made in extending the frontiers of quasar research deeper into the\\ncosmic dawn, in characterizing and understanding these objects in the context of early\\nSMBH growth and galaxy formation, and in using them as beacons to shed light on the\\nevolution of the IGM and the history of cosmic reionization.\\nSUMMARY POINTS\\n1. The current frontier of quasar research is at z∼7.6, with a large statistical sample\\nassembled at redshifts up to 7. High-redshift quasar selection is a challenging data\\nmining problem because of the rarity of the targets, the limited training sets, and\\nthe overwhelmingly large number of contaminant sources, both astrophysical and\\ninstrumental. We provide a database of the properties of all published quasars at\\nz>5.3 asSupplementary Material that accompanies this review.\\n2. The rapid evolution of the quasar LF has been well established. However, the\\nexact shape of the LF is still uncertain, both at the high luminosity end due to\\nsmall number statistics, and at the low luminosity end due to limitations of deep\\nsurveys. In sharp contrast, early quasars “look” almost identical to their low-\\nredshift counterparts in spectral properties. Even the earliest known quasars have\\na well-established AGN structure.\\n3. There are more than 100 z≳6 quasars with robust BH mass measurements. Their\\nmasses range from ∼4×107M⊙to∼1010M⊙. The BHs are growing at high Ed-\\ndington ratios ( λEﬀ,median = 0.79 andλEﬀ,mean = 0.92), with mild evidence of an\\nincrease of the accretion rate for z≳6.5 quasars in comparison to luminosity-\\nmatched quasar samples at lower redshifts.\\n4. The UV stellar light in z∼6 quasar hosts remains undetected, while on the other\\nhand, (sub)mm observations have revealed the existence of copious amounts of gas\\nand cold dust in many of these galaxies. Quasar hosts are massive, star-forming\\ngalaxies showing diverse morphology and kinematics; their average dynamical mass\\nappears lower than that based on the local scaling relation between BH and galaxy\\nmasses.\\n5. Lyαabsorption in quasars’ foreground IGM provides many of the most stringent\\nconstraints on the history of reionization, though the details of the observations\\nvary with redshift. Toward the end of reionization at z<6, counts of transmission\\n48 Fan et al.\\nspikes, dark gaps, and pixel optical depths indicate that universe is mostly ionized,\\nbut may harbor substantial islands of neutral matter as late as z∼5.3. Atz >7,\\nfour quasars have been discovered with prominent, metal-free damping wings that\\nare thought to represent oﬀ-resonance absorption from an IGM with neutral fraction\\n>10%, and possibly as high as 80%.\\n6. Heavy element absorption is seen in quasar spectra well into the epoch of reioniza-\\ntion, tracing chemical feedback from stars whose radiation is also transforming the\\nglobal ionization balance. It appears that these absorbers are high-redshift, low-\\nmetallicity analogs of damped Ly αabsorbers observed at lower redshift. However\\nthe highly ionized phase of the circumgalactic medium, seen universally in CIV at\\nz <6, abruptly vanishes in the EoR. This either indicates that the metals in the\\nCGM are undergoing their own ionization transition, or that the ionized phase of\\nthe CGM has not yet been enriched with heavy elements at z>6.\\nFUTURE ISSUES\\n1. With the new facilities planned for the next decade, we expect the quasar redshift\\nfrontier to reach redshift 9–10, when the ﬁrst generation of luminous quasars is\\nforming. A key challenge will be the spectroscopic conﬁrmation of these faint high-\\nredshift sources.\\n2. SMBH mass measurements using the H βline with JWST and gas-dynamical esti-\\nmates with ALMA (and eventually the ngVLA) will provide more accurate measure-\\nments than what is currently possible. These results will be crucial to test whether\\nthe current methods calibrated at low redshift (e.g., Mg iisingle-epoch virial mass)\\nstill hold at the highest accessible redshifts. To measure the BH masses of the pro-\\ngenitors of the currently observed z= 6−7 quasar population, NIR spectroscopic\\nfollow-up with the ELTs will be key.\\n3. JWST will likely be able to ﬁnally reveal stellar light from z≳6 quasar hosts.\\nALMA will continue playing a critical role in understanding and characterizing the\\ninterstellar medium of quasar host galaxies via multi-line diagnostics.\\n4. New quasar samples uncovered by Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope and\\nobserved with JWST and ELTs should substantially improve conﬁdence in z≥7\\nmeasurements of IGM damping wings. They will allow studies even deeper into the\\npast.\\n5. JWST already shows promise of being transformative for surveys of galaxies in ﬁelds\\nwhere high-redshift quasars have been used to constrain the IGM density ﬁeld. This\\nmay open the possibility of studying cross-correlations between Ly α, metals, and\\ngalaxies.\\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\\nThe authors are not aware of any aﬃliations, memberships, funding, or ﬁnancial holdings\\nthat might be perceived as aﬀecting the objectivity of this review.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 49\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe dedicate this review to the memory of Professor Maarten Schmidt, who passed away in\\nSeptember 2022 at the age of 92.

While the near-infrared (NIR) variability of Sgr A* was shown to be consistent\\nover two decades, unprecedented activity in 2019 challenges existing statistical models. We investigate\\nthe origin of this activity by re-calibrating and re-analyzing all of our Keck Observatory Sgr A* imaging\\nobservations from 2005-2022. We present light curves from 69 observation epochs using the NIRC2\\nimager at 2.12 µm with laser guide star adaptive optics. These observations reveal that the mean\\nluminosity of Sgr A* increased by a factor of ∼3 in 2019, and the 2019 light curves had higher variance\\nthan in all time periods we examined. We find that the 2020-2022 flux distribution is statistically\\nconsistent with the historical sample and model predictions, but with fewer bright measurements\\nabove 0.6 mJy at the ∼2σlevel. Since 2019, we have observed a maximum Ks(2.2µm) flux of 0.9\\nmJy, compared to the highest pre-2019 flux of 2.0 mJy and highest 2019 flux of 5.6 mJy. Our results\\nsuggest that the 2019 activity was caused by a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr A*, possibly due\\nto delayed accretion of tidally-stripped gas from the gaseous object G2 in 2014. We also examine faint\\nSgr A* fluxes over a long time baseline to search for a quasi-steady quiescent state. We find that Sgr\\nA* displays flux variations over a factor of ∼500, with no evidence for a quiescent state in the NIR.\\nKeywords: black hole physics, accretion, Galaxy: center, techniques: high angular resolution\\n1.INTRODUCTION\\nThe Milky Way’s Galactic center harbors the nearest\\nsupermassive black hole, providing a natural laboratory\\nfor detailed study of physical processes in its vicinity\\n(e.g. Sch¨ odel et al. 2003; Ghez et al. 2008). Observations\\nat radio, infrared, and X-ray wavelengths have revealed\\nthe Galactic black hole, Sgr A*, to be a continuously\\nvariable source (e.g. Falcke 1999; Baganoff et al. 2001;\\nGenzel et al. 2003). The detailed nature of the vari-\\nable emission can provide important constraints on how\\ngas is captured from the black hole’s surrounding envi-\\nronment, as well as on the physical phenomena taking\\nplace within the accretion flow as the matter approaches\\nCorresponding author: Grant C. Weldon\\ngweldon@astro.ucla.eduthe event horizon (e.g., reconnection events, hydrody-\\nnamic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, shocks,\\nand lensing caustics). While accretion processes have\\nbeen extensively studied in highly luminous active galac-\\ntic nuclei, Sgr A* is an example of the ubiquitous pop-\\nulation of low-luminosity galactic nuclei in the nearby\\nuniverse. By studying Sgr A*, we can learn more about\\naccretion processes in these systems (for recent reviews\\nsee Genzel et al. 2010; Morris et al. 2012).\\nNear-infrared (NIR) observations are particularly ef-\\nfective for monitoring the variability of Sgr A*. While\\nthe radio band traces small variations in the bulk ac-\\ncretion flow and the X-ray band is only sensitive to\\nstrong flares that rise above the extended local back-\\nground at the Galactic center, the resolved NIR source\\nshows both large and small variations that can almost\\nalways be detected using adaptive optics on the largestarXiv:2308.09749v1  [astro-ph.GA]  18 Aug 2023\\n2\\nground-based telescopes (e.g. Hornstein et al. 2002; Gen-\\nzel et al. 2003; Ghez et al. 2004; Meyer et al. 2014). The\\nNIR emission arises primarily from synchrotron radia-\\ntion very close ( ≲15 Schwarzschild radii) to the event\\nhorizon and can be used to bridge the radio and X-ray\\nbands to construct a coherent description of the emission\\nprocesses in radiatively-inefficient, advection-dominated\\nblack hole accretion flows (e.g. Fazio et al. 2018; Witzel\\net al. 2021).\\nThere have been numerous efforts to statistically char-\\nacterize the NIR variability. Do et al. (2009) showed\\nthat light curves from 2005-2007 can be described by a\\nred-noise process that is correlated in time and does not\\nexhibit periodicity or quasi-periodicity. Using observa-\\ntions from 2004-2009, Dodds-Eden et al. (2011) found\\nthe data to be described by a two-state model with a\\nlow-level log-normal component and a separate power-\\nlaw tail for flares. On the other hand, a recent com-\\nprehensive analysis of over 13,000 measurements of Sgr\\nA* flux density with Keck data at 2.12 µm (2003-2014)\\nand VLT and Spitzer data at 4.5 µm (2004-2017) found\\nthat the NIR time variability can indeed be consistently\\ndescribed by red noise, but that the entire distribution\\nof fluxes is well-fit by a single log-normal model without\\na separate flaring component (Witzel et al. 2018). By\\nre-analyzing speckle data from Keck (1995-2005), Chen\\net al. (2019) extended the time baseline of Sgr A* obser-\\nvations and showed that the statistical model of Witzel\\net al. (2018) remained consistent with the data over two\\ndecades through 2018.\\nHowever, in May 2019 Do et al. (2019) observed an\\nunprecedented bright NIR event with Keck. The flux of\\nSgr A* varied by a factor of 75 over a 2-hour timescale\\nand reached twice the level of any previous historical\\nNIR measurement. The maximum fluxes were observed\\nat the beginning of observations, suggesting that Sgr A*\\nwas likely even brighter prior to taking measurements\\nthat night. With additional bright events observed at\\nKeck in 2019, Do et al. (2019) showed the 2019 activ-\\nity to be inconsistent with the historical flux distribu-\\ntion of Witzel et al. (2018). Additionally, a high abun-\\ndance of bright NIR events were observed with VLT\\nin 2019 relative to other years (Gravity Collaboration\\net al. 2020). Heightened activity was also seen in the ra-\\ndio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al. 2022;\\nCheng et al. 2023) and X-ray regimes (e.g. Pavlinsky\\n2019; Degenaar et al. 2019). These observations collec-\\ntively suggest that Sgr A* displayed unusual behavior\\nin 2019, making this era useful for understanding the\\ntime-variable accretion flow onto the black hole.Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the\\nelevated 2019 activity. These possibilities and their ob-\\nservable signatures include the following.\\n1. The statistical models of Sgr A* in the NIR need\\nto be updated to capture the bright events. While\\nWitzel et al. (2018) found that historical mea-\\nsurements follow a single log-normal distribution,\\nGravity Collaboration et al. (2020) argues that\\nthe 2019 bright events observed by Keck and VLT\\nare rare events drawn from the power-law tail of\\nthe underlying two-state distribution described by\\nDodds-Eden et al. (2011). In such two-state mod-\\nels, the faint distribution arises from steady accre-\\ntion of mass from the black hole’s environment,\\nand the flaring state arises from a separate pro-\\ncess that injects additional energy. A related ques-\\ntion concerns whether there exists a quasi-steady,\\nquiescent “floor” to the Sgr A* light curves or\\nwhether Sgr A* displays similar variability char-\\nacteristics at both faint and high levels (e.g. Do\\net al. 2009). Previous studies have historically\\nbeen complicated by short time baselines or have\\nnot closely examined the faint end of the flux dis-\\ntribution. We can examine Sgr A* at low flux\\ndensities over a long time baseline to determine\\nwhether such a quiescent state exists and to study\\nwhether the statistical character of the emission\\nat faint flux densities is simply an extension of\\nwhat we see at higher flux densities. We can also\\nstudy whether the faint flux densities are different\\nin 2019 than in other years. If the 2019 events\\nare indicative of a power-law “flaring” state dis-\\ntinct from the log-normal “quiescent” state, we\\nshould see only the flaring state affected and the\\nfaint end of the flux distribution unchanged be-\\ntween 2019 and other years. A shift in the faint\\nend of the flux distribution in 2019 would instead\\nsuggest that Sgr A* experienced a physical change\\nduring this time.\\n2. There was a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr\\nA*. The Galactic center hosts a population of\\nstars and dusty G-objects, which could affect the\\naccretion flow. The star S0-2 underwent closest\\napproach in 2018, and its passage may have in-\\nduced an accretion disturbance (Loeb 2004). In\\nthe past two decades, the objects G1 and G2 un-\\nderwent closest approach and showed signs of tidal\\ninteraction with the black hole, causing much spec-\\nulation about the potential for excess material\\nfrom these objects to induce heightened Sgr A*\\nactivity (e.g. Gillessen et al. 2012; Phifer et al.\\n3\\n2013; Eckart et al. 2013; Witzel et al. 2014; Pfuhl\\net al. 2015; Witzel et al. 2017; Plewa et al. 2017;\\nGillessen et al. 2019). While an increase in X-ray\\nflares was reported following G2’s passage in 2014\\n(Ponti et al. 2015), no exceptional NIR activity\\nwas reported in the years immediately following\\n2014. However, it is possible that there is a larger\\ntime delay between the passage of G2 and any ob-\\nserved NIR activity (e.g Kawashima et al. 2017;\\nMurchikova 2021). If a neighboring source, such as\\nS0-2 or G2, deposited gas or altered the accretion\\nflow onto Sgr A*, we would expect to see height-\\nened activity for the duration of time it takes that\\nmaterial to fall into the black hole, followed by a\\nreturn to more typical behavior.\\n3. Sgr A* has entered a new accretion state in which\\nbright flares are more common, or the 2019 ac-\\ntivity is a precursor to an even larger event (Do\\net al. 2019). Observations of X-ray light echoes\\nfrom iron line emission at the Galactic center sug-\\ngest that in the past several hundred years, Sgr\\nA* has undergone multiple ( ∼2-10 year) luminos-\\nity increases by factors of up to 105(e.g. Ponti\\net al. 2010; Clavel et al. 2013; Terrier et al. 2018;\\nChuard et al. 2018). If Sgr A* is undergoing a state\\nchange or entering an extreme episode, we should\\nsee the activity of Sgr A* continue or evolve in the\\nyears beyond 2019.\\nTo test these hypotheses, we must compare the be-\\nhavior of Sgr A* before, during, and after 2019 at both\\nlow and high flux densities. Previous studies used dif-\\nferent photometric methods (e.g. aperture photometry,\\npoint spread function fitting, interferometry) and vary-\\ning treatments for stellar contamination of Sgr A*, mak-\\ning the comparison of absolute flux densities unreliable,\\nespecially at fainter levels. In this work, we present\\nSgr A* observations using Keck Observatory from 2005-\\n2022, all reduced with the same methodology, allowing\\nfor a robust comparison of flux densities over time. This\\nstudy includes re-reduced data from Witzel et al. (2018)\\nand Do et al. (2019), as well as newly presented histor-\\nical data (2005-2017; Sgr A* is confused by the bright\\nstar S0-2 in 2018) and more recent observations taken\\nin 2019 and from 2020-2022. Section 2 describes these\\nobservations and data reduction. Section 3 presents the\\nanalysis of the flux distributions, comparisons to the his-\\ntorical model, characteristics of the light curves, and\\ntiming analyses. Section 4 discusses the physical impli-\\ncations of our results. We conclude in Section 5.\\n2.OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION2.1. Keck observations\\nOur observations of the Galactic center were taken\\nwith the Keck 2 Telescope using the narrow camera in\\nthe Near-Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2) imager with the\\nLaser-Guide Star Adaptive Optics (LGS AO) system\\n(Wizinowich et al. 2006). All of the Keck observations\\nin this work were taken with the K′filter (2.12 µm).\\nIndividual K′images consist of 10 coadds of 2.8-second\\nintegration time each. Standard image reduction meth-\\nods were applied, including flat-fielding, sky subtraction,\\nand cosmic ray removal via the Keck AO Imaging (KAI)\\ndata reduction pipeline (Lu et al. 2021).\\nPhotometry was performed on individual images to\\nconstruct light curves for Sgr A*. We used the point\\nspread function (PSF) fitting program Starfinder to\\nmeasure the brightness and position of sources (Diolaiti\\net al. 2000). Using the same procedure as in Do et al.\\n(2019), a different PSF was constructed for each image\\nto account for changes in effective PSF due to seeing\\nvariations. To increase the number of Sgr A* detec-\\ntions at faint flux levels, we used an enhanced version\\nofStarfinder that includes a priori knowledge of the\\nlocation of Sgr A* and other nearby NIR sources (Horn-\\nstein et al. 2007). For each epoch, the source locations\\nin a nightly-averaged image were used as fixed inputs\\ninto Starfinder to more accurately fit for Sgr A* and\\nneighboring sources in the individual frames.\\nOur photometric calibration has been updated since\\nDo et al. (2019), making the observed flux densities of\\nall sources within the central arcsecond of the Galactic\\ncenter (including Sgr A*) systematically lower by ∼10%.\\nPhotometric uncertainties were estimated by fitting a\\npower law between the flux and RMS flux uncertainty\\nfor stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*, as described in Do\\net al. (2009). We then used this relationship to calculate\\nthe uncertainty in flux for Sgr A*. More details about\\nour photometric calibration and uncertainty estimations\\ncan be found in Appendix A. The photometric stability\\nof our observations is discussed in Appendix B.\\nIn this study, we work with observed flux densities\\n(rather than dereddened) to make our results compara-\\nble to Do et al. (2019). We convert our observed K′\\nfluxes to observed Ksfluxes using the filter transforma-\\ntionFKs= 1.09FK′(Do et al. 2019). Dereddened fluxes\\ncan be computed using Fdereddened =Fobs×100.4AKs.\\nDifferent studies have used different extinction values,\\nsuch as AKs= 2.46 (Sch¨ odel et al. 2010), AKs= 2.8\\n(Genzel et al. 2003; Eckart et al. 2006), AKs= 3.2\\n(Hornstein et al. 2007), and AKs= 3.3 (Do et al. 2009).\\nAs in Do et al. (2019), we will occasionally aid readers by\\npresenting both observed and dereddened flux densities\\ncomputed using AKs= 2.46.\\n4\\n2.2. Sample selection\\nWe introduce several selection criteria to make our\\nKeck data set more robust for comparing Sgr A* vari-\\nability over time. Beginning with 104 Galactic center\\nobservation epochs from 2005-2022, we apply the fol-\\nlowing successive cuts to our sample:\\n1. Considering only observing epochs in which 20\\nor more quality (Strehl ratio >0.2) images of the\\nGalactic center were taken. Below 20 frames, the\\nlight curves are poorly sampled for timing analy-\\nses. 18 such epochs are removed from our sample.\\n2. Removing epochs in which our PSF reference stars\\nare saturated. Saturated PSF reference stars in-\\ntroduce a photometric bias that makes our Sgr A*\\nflux measurements unreliable. 3 such epochs are\\nremoved from our sample.3. Removing epochs in which the bright star S0-2 ( K\\n= 14.2 mag) is confused with Sgr A* (in late 2017\\nand 2018). Attempting to correct for S0-2’s flux\\nbias introduces large uncertainties that are compa-\\nrable to faint Sgr A* flux levels. 14 such epochs are\\nremoved, leaving 69 observation epochs for con-\\nsideration. For epochs in which a fainter S-star\\nis confused with Sgr A*, we apply a photometric\\ncorrection (see Appendix H for procedure).\\n4. Considering only images with Strehl ratio greater\\nthan 0.2 within each of the 69 remaining nights. At\\nlower Strehl ratios, the photometry is unreliable\\ndue to poor seeing conditions. About 10% of 7935\\nframes have Strehl ratios below 0.2, leaving 7155\\nframes that survive our data quality cut.\\nThe 69 observation epochs that we have selected for\\nour sample are described in Table 1.

Significantly different flux distribution in 2019\\n6\\nThe flux distributions of Sgr A* reveal that flux densi-\\nties in 2019 were elevated at both faint and bright levels,\\nand that the post-2019 activity of Sgr A* is statistically\\nconsistent with the pre-2019 activity. We construct his-\\ntograms of the light curves and present the flux distribu-\\ntions for the pre-2019 (2005-2017), 2019, and post-2019\\n(2020-2022) epochs in Figure 1. In our sample, Sgr A*\\nis detected ∼93% of the time. Our treatment of non-\\ndetections is discussed in Appendix E.\\nAs shown in Do et al. (2019), the 2019 distribution\\nhas a tail extending to high flux densities that is not\\npresent before 2019. Our post-2019 results show no such\\nextended tail, indicating that we have seen no high flux\\ndensities at 2019 levels in more recent years. We observe\\nthat the shapes of the pre- and post-2019 distributions\\nappear to be quite similar, whereas the 2019 distribution\\nappears skewed to higher flux densities.\\nWe are also able to measure the long-term median\\nof the flux distribution, enabled by our consistent re-\\nduction methodology with photometric corrections for\\nstellar confusion. We find that the median of the 2019\\ndistribution is 0.20 mJy (1.9 mJy dereddened), which\\ndoubles the 0.10 mJy (1.0 mJy dereddened) medians of\\nthe pre- and post-2019 distributions. Other percentiles\\nof the flux distribution are presented in Table 2. We\\nobserve that in addition to the median, the flux levels of\\n2019 are elevated at all percentiles compared to the pre-\\nceding and succeeding distributions, demonstrating that\\nthe 2019 behavior was indeed unusual beyond merely\\nthe extremely bright event of 2019-05-13. On the other\\nhand, nearly all percentiles are similar between the pre-\\nand post-2019 distributions. The exception is at the\\nhigh flux end, where discrepancies between the pre- and\\npost-2019 distributions are explained by a recent lack of\\nbright flux excursions. Furthermore, by adding our flux\\ndistributions and dividing by the number of observations\\nwithin each time period, we can compare the average lu-\\nminosity of Sgr A* at 2.12 µm. We find that Sgr A* was\\non average ∼3 times more luminous at this wavelength\\nin 2019 than in the pre-2019 observations. Since 2019,\\nSgr A* has had an average luminosity of ∼0.9 times its\\npre-2019 luminosity.\\nWe can use two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests\\nto quantitatively compare our flux distributions. We\\nnote that KS-tests assume independent measurements\\nand Sgr A* light curves are time-correlated on an intra-\\nnight basis; however, as in Do et al. (2019), we can\\ncompare flux distributions with multiple nights of ob-\\nservations that are uncorrelated with one another to\\nroughly compare the general behavior of Sgr A* over\\nlong time periods. We use the inferred flux distributions\\n(described in Appendix E) to mitigate the bias inducedby non-detections. Performing a KS-test between our\\npre-2019 and 2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of\\n0.39 ( p≪1), showing it is highly unlikely that these\\ndata sets come from the same underlying distribution.\\nDo et al. (2019) also used a KS-test and found a large\\ndisagreement between the 2019 sample and historical\\ndata. Performing a KS-test between our 2019 and post-\\n2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of 0.36 ( p≪1),\\nshowing these data sets are also highly unlikely to come\\nfrom the same underlying distribution. On the other\\nhand, performing a KS-test between our pre-2019 and\\npost-2019 distributions yields a much lower KS-statistic\\nof 0.04 ( p∼0.03), showing these distributions are more\\nsimilar. If we restrict our KS-test to flux densities above\\n0.05 mJy (where non-detections become negligible), we\\nfind a comparable KS-statistic of 0.05 ( p∼0.01). Based\\non these results, we find that the pre-2019 and post-2019\\nflux distributions of Sgr A* agree at the ∼2σlevel.\\nFigure 1. Measured flux distributions of Sgr A* scaled to com-\\npare peaks and shapes of the pre-2019 (blue), 2019 (black), and\\npost-2019 (orange) distributions, with dashed lines showing the\\ndistribution medians. We find that the 2019 flux distribution is\\nelevated with respect to the pre- and post-2019 distributions.\\nIn addition to consistency between the pre-2019 and\\npost-2019 flux distributions, we find that the post-2019\\ndata agree with model predictions. As in Do et al.\\n(2019), we compare the observations to the model 3\\nof Witzel et al. (2018), which is a log-normally dis-\\ntributed red noise process. This model was informed\\nby over 13,000 infrared measurements from Keck, VLT,\\nand Spitzer and importantly accounts for the temporal\\ncorrelations of Sgr A*’s flux with time. For each of our\\nthree samples (pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019), we draw\\n10,000 parameter combinations from the posterior and\\nfor each parameter combination, generate a single light\\ncurve with the time sampling of the nights in the respec-\\ntive sample (45 nights for pre-2019, 6 nights for 2019,\\n7\\nTable 2.

In Figure 2, we present a\\ncomparison of the observed data with the median, 1 σ,\\n2σ, and 3 σcredible intervals of the complementary cu-\\nmulative distribution function (CCDF ≡1 - CDF) for\\neach set of 10,000 simulated light curves.\\nConsistent with the expectation that our historical\\nsample should agree with the established model, our\\npre-2019 observations match the historical model at the\\n1-2σlevel. We find that the 2019 bright flux excursions\\nfall outside of the model’s 3 σintervals, as shown in Do\\net al. (2019), but with new observations from late 2019.\\nOf most interest to this study is the behavior of Sgr\\nA* in the years since 2019. We find that the post-2019\\nobservations fall within the predictions of the historical\\nmodel. The lack of high fluxes in more recent years does\\nplace these observations below model predictions at the\\n∼2.5σlevel (for fluxes reaching ∼0.6 mJy, i.e. all the\\ndata except the two brightest events) and at the ∼1.5σ\\nlevel for the highest measured flux densities. While ad-\\nditional observations in coming years may reveal a more\\nstatistically significant lack of activity, our current re-\\nsults demonstrate that the recent observations are con-\\nsistent with historical expectations at the ∼2σlevel. Sgr\\nA* has displayed statistically typical, albeit diminished\\nlevels of activity.\\n3.1.1. Impact of the brightest night on the flux distribution\\nWe examine the impact that the night with the bright-\\nest event (2019-05-13) has on our results by constructing\\nthe 2019 flux distribution without this night. This in-\\nvestigation is motivated by the possibility of 2019 being\\nan otherwise ordinary era with a single rare event that\\nbiases the flux distribution to higher levels. The flux dis-\\ntribution and percentiles with this night removed can be\\nfound in Appendix F. We find that the removal of this\\nnight certainly impacts the high end of the flux distri-\\nbution, but the median of the distribution remains the\\nsame and the peak of the distribution remains shifted to\\nhigher flux levels with respect to the historical distribu-\\ntion. Although the other nights in 2019 individually do\\nFigure 2.

(2018).\\nThese simulations show that while the 2019 data are inconsistent\\nwith model predictions at the >3σlevel, the pre- and post-2019\\nactivity generally agrees with the model at the 1-2 σlevel. We note\\nthat our 2019 data includes additional observations from late 2019\\nthat were not incorporated into the analysis of Do et al. (2019).\\n8\\nnot reach unprecedented levels, together they display a\\nrelative concentration of high flux densities. A KS-test\\nbetween the pre-2019 distribution and the 2019 distribu-\\ntion without the brightest night yields a KS-statistic of\\n0.42 ( p≪1), reinforcing that these data sets are highly\\ndissimilar. As such, we conclude that our finding that\\nthe 2019 flux distribution is significantly different is ro-\\nbust whether or not the brightest night is included. The\\ninclusion of this night only bolsters the result.\\n3.2. Bright events in the NIR Sgr A* light curve\\nThe light curve of Sgr A* over 17 years shows the\\nheightened flux densities in 2019 and relative lack of ac-\\ntivity in the following years (see Figure 3). To construct\\nthis light curve, we stitch together the pre-2019, 2019,\\nand post-2019 data and remove time gaps between ob-\\nservation epochs. Individual light curves from each of\\nthese three subsets displaying both bright and faint flux\\ndensities are shown in Appendix G.\\nWe find no bright fluxes in the post-2019 data at the\\nlevel of the two brightest events in 2019. In six nights of\\n2019 observations, the two brightest events have maxi-\\nmum flux densities of 5.58 ±0.04 mJy (corresponding to\\n53.8 mJy dereddened) and 1.56 ±0.03 mJy (15.0 mJy\\ndereddened). In seven nights of observations in 2020\\nand 2021, the highest flux density measured is only 0.60\\n±0.04 mJy (5.8 mJy dereddened). In 11 observation\\nepochs in 2022, we observed only two bright flux excur-\\nsions with maximum flux densities of 0.74 ±0.06 mJy\\n(7.1 mJy dereddened) and 0.93 ±0.03 mJy (9.0 mJy\\ndereddened). Neither of these are comparable to the\\n2019 events.\\nThere is also a lack of bright flux excursions in the\\npost-2019 data as compared to the pre-2019 data. We\\nobserve four events in the pre-2019 data (counting two\\non 2010-05-05) with flux densities greater than 1 mJy\\nand no flux densities at this level post-2019. Six events\\nwith flux densities greater than 0.8 mJy are observed in\\nthe pre-2019 data, and only one is observed post-2019.\\nThe post-2019 sample is only ∼43% as long as the pre-\\n2019 sample, but there remains a relative absence of\\nbright fluxes in more recent years.\\n3.3. Sgr A* has no quiescent state in the NIR\\nOur new methodology allows for measurements of\\nfaint flux densities in the NIR over 17 years and the abil-\\nity to search for a quiescent, quasi-steady state. Such a\\nstate would present itself as a “floor” to the Sgr A* light\\ncurve. This study is the first to examine faint Sgr A*\\nflux densities from 2005-2022 while making corrections\\nfor stellar confusion, allowing for reliable comparisons of\\nfaint Sgr A* flux densities over a long time baseline to\\nsearch for such a floor.We find that there is no quasi-steady floor to the NIR\\nSgr A* light curve at faint flux densities. When viewed\\nin linear flux space (such as the upper light curve in Fig-\\nure 3), Sgr A* does appear to spend most of its time in\\na faint state that is punctuated by bright “flares”. How-\\never, the data show that Sgr A* has been highly variable\\neven at low flux densities over 17 years. By examining\\nthe light curve in logarithmic flux density space (bottom\\nlight curve in Figure 3), we see that Sgr A* shows no qui-\\nescent state in the NIR and instead displays stochastic\\nvariability over a factor of ∼500 in flux. Flux densities\\ndo not level off at some faint value, but are continuously\\nand significantly variable down to about 0.01 mJy (0.1\\nmJy dereddened), which is the limit where we are able\\nto detect Sgr A* with >1σconfidence and which only a\\nsmall fraction of frames likely fall below.\\n3.4. Timing characteristics of the light curves\\nWe can use the first order structure function to exam-\\nine the timing characteristics of the NIR light curves,\\nas is often done in timing analyses for both Sgr A* and\\nextragalactic AGN (e.g. Simonetti et al. 1985; Hughes\\net al. 1992; Do et al. 2009). The structure function ulti-\\nmately allows one to determine the power spectral den-\\nsity (PSD) slope for a set of unevenly sampled data. For\\na light curve with flux measurements F(t) at times t, the\\nfirst order structure function V(τ) is defined as\\nV(τ)≡ ⟨[F(t+τ)−F(t)]2⟩. (1)\\nWe bin the time lags τand distribute the V(τ) values\\ninto the corresponding bins. Logarithmic binning is used\\nto more evenly distribute data points into bins, as there\\nare many more samples for smaller time lags. The aver-\\nage of V(τ) values within each bin is used as the struc-\\nture function value for that bin. The error associated\\nwith each bin is σbin/√Nbin, where σbinis the standard\\ndeviation of V(τ) values within that bin and Nbinis the\\nnumber of values in the bin. The structure functions\\nfor the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 light curves are\\npresented in Figure 4.\\nThe logarithmic slope of the structure function β\\n(where V(τ)∝τβ) can be related to the power law index\\nαof the PSD ( P∝f−α) for each of the pre-2019, 2019,\\nand post-2019 samples. To make the conversion from\\nmeasured measured βtoα, we generate 103light curves\\nwith the respective time sampling and fixed PSD slope\\nα, then measure the structure function slope β. This\\nprocedure is repeated for varying values of αbetween\\nα= 1.5 and α= 3.0. We perform a linear fit between α\\nandβ(see Appendix I), then use this linear fit to convert\\nthe structure function slopes we measure in the real data\\nto PSD slopes.

The structure function slope\\nβis measured in the regime where the structure function\\nis approximately linear (5-40 minutes) to avoid artifacts\\nfrom three-minute dithering and increased white noise\\nin the observations at short time lags.

We find\\na steeper αfor 2019 and a shallower αfor the post-2019\\ndata. However, it is worth noting that a more signifi-\\ncant white noise component from stellar contamination\\nin 2020-2022 could cause us to measure a shallower slope\\nfor these years (see Appendix I).

In 2020-\\n2022, the behavior of Sgr A* was statistically similar,\\nbut slightly diminished compared to that of 2005-2017.\\nWe also find that Sgr A* has no quiescent state over 17\\nyears of NIR observations. These findings have implica-\\ntions for understanding the time-variable accretion flow\\nonto Sgr A*.\\nThe pronounced shift in the 2019 median flux density\\nsuggests that Sgr A* experienced a heightened accretion\\nrate, revealing that the 2019 NIR activity was extraor-\\ndinary beyond just the bright events.

(2020) also reported an elevated median in\\n2019 (compared to the years 2017 and 2018), although\\nit was found not statistically significant given the num-\\nber of observations over a time baseline of 3 years. Our\\ntime baseline of 17 years provides stronger evidence for\\na shift in the median of the flux distribution in 2019.\\nThe two-state model for the flux distribution with a log-\\nnormal quiescent state and power-law tail (Dodds-Eden\\net al. 2011; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020) interprets\\nbright flares as manifestations of such a tail, but does\\nnot account for the changes to the faint emission that we\\nobserve in 2019 in this study. Because we see elevated\\nactivity at both low and high levels in 2019, explana-\\ntions invoking a physical change to Sgr A*’s accretion\\nstate are favored over a new statistical model.\\nMulti-wavelength observations of Sgr A* in 2019 also\\nfavor a physical change to the accretion flow. The tem-\\nporal concentration of high fluxes observed in 2019 by\\nKeck and VLT in the NIR, as well as heightened activ-\\nity in radio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al.\\n2022; Cheng et al. 2023) and X-rays (e.g. Pavlinsky 2019;\\nDegenaar et al. 2019) is also evidence for a physical dis-\\nturbance during 2019. If Sgr A*’s variability were bet-\\nter characterized by a different underlying distribution\\nthan that of Witzel et al. (2018) (a single stochastic pro-\\ncess with a log-normal distribution), we would expect tosee bright events and elevated multi-wavelength activity\\nmore evenly distributed over two decades, rather than\\nclustered together in a single year.\\nOur results favor models in which extra gas was de-\\nposited onto the black hole in 2019, temporarily increas-\\ning the accretion rate and stimulating the production of\\nfrequent bright events. Such models include a distur-\\nbance induced by the closest approach of the star S0-2\\nin 2018 or the delayed infall of gas pulled from a tidal in-\\nteraction with the dusty object G2 in 2014. Kawashima\\net al. (2017) predicted a time-delayed radio and infrared\\nbrightening of Sgr A* around 2020 caused by the pas-\\nsage of G2. In their simulations, the magnetic energy\\nwithin the accretion disk increases by a factor of 3-4 af-\\nter∼5 years following the passage of G2. Murchikova\\n(2021) calculates that the infall time of material from G2\\n(and the possible simultaneous infall of material from\\nthe object G1) more closely matches the time delay be-\\ntween pericenter passage and flaring time than that of\\nS0-2. Hydrodynamic simulations have also shown that\\nwinds from the passage of S0-2 are unlikely to have a\\nmeasurable effect on the inner accretion flow (Ressler\\net al. 2018). If the 2019 activity was indeed caused by a\\ntemporary accretion increase, these findings collectively\\nfavor the G2 hypothesis over the S0-2 hypothesis as a\\nsource for the excess material.\\nWe rule out a long-term elevated accretion state, as\\nthe variability of Sgr A* resembles its past activity and\\nno extraordinarily bright events have been observed in\\nmore recent years. In fact, we have noted a slight\\nlowering of the post-2019 flux distribution at the high\\nend, although this effect is not statistically significant.\\nNumerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical\\n(GRMHD) simulations have revealed that bright flares\\npowered by magnetic reconnection can eject part of the\\naccretion disk and suppress the mass accretion rate onto\\nthe black hole (Ripperda et al. 2022). Changes to the\\nmagnetic flux content of the disk in simulations have\\nmeasurable effects on the light curves and flux distri-\\nbutions of Sgr A* (Chatterjee et al. 2021). The lack\\nof high flux densities post-2019 and the slight decrease\\nin mean luminosity could imply that the 2019 activity\\naltered the accretion flow onto Sgr A* for an extended\\nperiod of time. With more observations, we will be able\\n11\\nto determine whether the relative inactivity of Sgr A*\\nin more recent years is in fact statistically significant.\\nA major challenge to precision measurement of the\\nflux distribution of Sgr A* is stellar confusion. Recent\\nobservations with NIR interferometry (e.g. Gravity Col-\\nlaboration et al. 2020) have improved angular resolution\\nand reduced the impact of confusion on flux measure-\\nments, but such observations of Sgr A* have only be-\\ngun in 2017. Single-telescope data is complementary to\\ninterferometric data because it offers a long time base-\\nline to compare the behavior of Sgr A* across decades,\\nbut as in this work, care must be taken to account for\\nconfusion. Future work to combine single-telescope and\\ninterferometric data sets would help reduce systematics\\nin the study of Sgr A* variability.\\n5.CONCLUSION\\nEach hypothesis for the 2019 activity of Sgr A* is\\nscientifically plausible for understanding the activity in\\nterms of an excess accretion flow onto the black hole.\\nIf we are able to trace the activity to S0-2 or G2, we\\nwill directly connect the supermassive black hole’s feed-\\ning behavior to an object in its vicinity and learn more\\nabout how neighboring objects supply material for the\\nblack hole to accrete. If Sgr A* has undergone a change\\nof state, we will catch a real-time glimpse into the phys-\\nical response of a supermassive black hole accretion flow\\nto an increase in gas flow. In any case, it is important to\\ndetermine whether the 2019 activity is representative of\\nSgr A*’s typical behavior or a period of extraordinary\\nactivity. If the former, the 2019 activity should be in-\\ncluded in long-term models of Sgr A*. If the latter, the\\nunusual behavior should be treated as a separate period\\nwith distinct physical characteristics.\\nTo investigate the origin of the 2019 activity, we have\\ndone the following:\\n•Performed a consistent reduction of Keck Sgr A*\\nobservations from 2005-2022 with new treatment\\nfor stellar confusion to enable a robust comparison\\nof flux densities over nearly two decades\\n•Demonstrated that both faint and bright 2019 flux\\ndensities were significantly elevated with respect\\nto pre- and post-2019 observations\\n•Shown that the average luminosity of Sgr A* was\\n∼3 times higher than historical measurements in\\n2019 and ∼0.9 times historical measurements in\\nthe years 2020-2022\\n•Shown that while the post-2019 observations are\\nstatistically consistent with the historical sample,\\nas well as with the statistical model of Witzel et al.(2018), we have observed a relative deficiency in\\nactivity in 2020-2022 at the ∼2σlevel\\n•Demonstrated that 2019 showed heightened vari-\\nability with respect to the years before and after,\\nindicating that a greater average luminosity seems\\ncorrelated with more extreme variability\\n•Found no evidence for a NIR quiescent state of Sgr\\nA*; Sgr A* displays stochastic flux variations over\\na factor of ∼500 and is continuously variable down\\nto about 0.01 mJy\\nWe argue that the observed increase in NIR flux den-\\nsities in 2019, along with the concentration of bright\\nevents measured by many observatories that year, points\\nto a transient increase in accretion activity during 2019.\\nIn these models, excess gas is temporarily deposited onto\\nthe black hole from the closest approach of a nearby ob-\\nject, raising the median flux and increasing the probabil-\\nity of bright events. Numerical simulations and analytic\\ncalculations have favored the black hole’s tidal interac-\\ntion with G2 in 2014 as a source for this excess material.\\nFurther modeling of G-object interactions with the ac-\\ncretion flow and their ability to cause the 2019 activity\\nshould be done to provide a more robust comparison to\\nobservations.\\nWe have ruled out the hypothesis that 2019 is a pre-\\ncursor to a long-term elevated accretion state, as the\\ncurrent behavior of Sgr A* resembles its behavior be-\\nfore 2019, and we have seen a lack of high fluxes in more\\nrecent years. Future NIR observations will continue to\\nmonitor the black hole for signs of increased (or de-\\ncreased) activity. Further analyses of multi-wavelength\\ndata will help us compare the physical mechanisms be-\\nhind the bright events of 2019 and other years.\\nWe thank the anonymous referee for their helpful com-\\nments.

(2019) and Gautam et al.\\n(2019). The magnitude difference between the previous and new photometric calibrations for sources in the central 10\\narcseconds is 0 .093±0.003 and in the central 1 arsecond in 0 .096±0.003, with stars being systematically fainter in the\\nnew calibration (see Figure 5). In this work, we used the following calibrator stars: IRS 16NW, S3-22, S1-17, S1-34,\\nS4-3, S1-1, S1-21, S3-370, S3-88, S3-36, and S2-63. We derived reference flux measurements for the selected calibrator\\nstars using the Sch¨ odel et al. (2010) photometric catalog transformed to the Keck NIRC2 bandpasses. The procedure\\nto transform fluxes from VLT NACO KsandH-bands to Keck NIRC2 K′andH-bands is described in more detail in\\nGautam et al. (2019). More details of our new photometric calibration are forthcoming in Gautam et al. in prep.\\nPhotometric uncertainties were estimated by fitting a power law between the flux level and RMS flux uncertainty\\nfor stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*, as described in Do et al. (2009). We then used this relationship to calculate\\nthe uncertainty in flux measurements for Sgr A*. The photometric uncertainties are generally less than 15% for\\nlow flux values ( ≲0.2 mJy) and less than 5% for high flux values ( ≳0.2 mJy). Sample power law fits to determine\\nflux measurement uncertainties are shown in Figure 6. The flux uncertainties for central arcsecond sources are not\\nsignificantly different between the previous and new photometric calibrations.\\nFigure 5. Comparison of observed magnitudes for Galactic center sources between the photometric calibration of Do et al. (2019) and\\nthe new calibration in this work (Gautam et al. in prep.), as a function of magnitude in the new calibration. We see that sources are\\nsystematically fainter by about 10% with the new calibration.\\nB.PHOTOMETRIC STABILITY\\nWe investigate the photometric stability of our observations by constructing flux distributions for two comparison\\nstars, S1-1 and S1-33, that are known to not be variable and span nearly an order of magnitude in flux (Gautam et al. in\\nprep). The pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 flux distributions of these stars and the nightly mean and standard deviation\\nof the fluxes are presented in Figure 7. We find that the differences between the means and standard deviations of the\\nflux distributions of these stars is not significant between the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 eras. The total 2005-2022\\nflux distribution for S1-1 can be described by a Gaussian with a width of ∼3%, and that of S1-33 can be described by\\na Gaussian with a width of ∼5%. The scatter of mean flux levels between individual nights for S1-1 is ∼2% and for\\nS1-33 is ∼4%. Within individual nights, the average scatter is ∼1% for S1-1 and ∼3% for S1-33. As such, between\\nall of our observations we are able to consistently reproduce the fluxes of S1-1 and S1-33 at the level of a few percent.\\nThe fluctuations in flux density for these non-variable stars are much smaller than the variations in Sgr A* flux density\\nthat we find, indicating that the shifts in the Sgr A* flux distributions that we report are photometrically robust.\\nC.OBSERVATION EPOCHS OMITTED\\nIn Section 2.2, we describe the successive cuts made to our sample to ensure robust photometry and comparisons of\\nSgr A* activity over time. Out of the 104 Galactic center K′observing epochs taken with Keck from 2005-2022, the\\n35 that we have omitted from our analysis are given in Table 4, along with the reasons for omission.\\n15\\nFigure 6. Sample power law fits to the RMS fluxes for stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A* within the typical Sgr A* flux range. Shown\\nhere are the fits for three observing epochs (2010-05-05, 2019-05-13, 2022-05-21). We perform this procedure for each of the 69 nights in\\nour sample and use the respective power law fits to determine the uncertainties on the Sgr A* flux measurements.\\nFigure 7.

The inter- and intra-night scatters\\nof S1-1 and S1-33 are less than ∼5%, indicating we are able to consistently reproduce flux densities at this level.\\n16\\nTable 4.

However,\\nbecause the flux of Sgr A* does not vary significantly between consecutive frames, we can estimate the values of\\nnon-detected fluxes based on the lowest neighboring flux measurement in the light curves. Comparisons between the\\nmeasured and inferred flux distributions are shown in Figure 8. We find that Sgr A* is detected >99% of the time\\nabove FKs= 0.05 mJy. ∼26% of frames in the pre-2019 distribution, ∼12% of frames in the 2019 distribution, and\\n17\\nTable 5.

Missing flux and magnitude values in the full\\ntable correspond to non-detections of Sgr A*.\\n∼24% of frames in the post-2019 distribution fall below this threshold. As such, while we estimate flux distribution\\npercentiles using the inferred flux distributions, the median (50th percentile) values we present are not biased by the\\nnon-detections.

The values of\\nnon-detections in the inferred distributions are estimated from neighboring flux measurements in the light curves.\\nF.2019 FLUX DISTRIBUTION WITH BRIGHTEST NIGHT REMOVED\\nIn Section 3.1.1, we discuss how removing the night with the highest flux densities (2019-05-13) impacts our analysis\\nof the flux distribution. Figure 9 shows the 2019 flux distribution without the brightest night, and Table 6 shows the\\npercentiles of the flux distribution.\\nG.INDIVIDUAL LIGHT CURVES\\nWe present some individual light curves from pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 observing epochs to demonstrate the\\nrange of variability that Sgr A* exhibits. Figure 10 shows some of the brightest measured flux densities and Figure 11\\ncontains light curves displaying relatively low activity.\\nH.STELLAR CONFUSION CORRECTION\\nThe Galactic center is a crowded field with stars occasionally confusing Sgr A* on the sky, so we must consider how\\nextended PSFs from nearby stellar sources contaminate the measured Sgr A* flux. Previous studies (e.g. Witzel et al.\\n18\\nFigure 9. Flux distributions of Sgr A* scaled to compare peaks and shapes of the pre-2019 distribution (blue), 2019 distribution (black),\\nand 2019 distribution with the brightest night removed (gold), with dashed lines showing the distribution medians. Although removing\\nthe brightest night lowers the high flux end of the 2019 distribution, the peak of the 2019 distribution remains elevated with respect to the\\nhistorical distribution, and the 2019 median is unchanged.\\nTable 6.

This procedure makes all the\\ndata comparable, but deletes information about potential shifts in the median flux density caused by changes in the\\naccretion rate. In this study, we seek to measure the shift in the median of the flux distribution between 2019 and\\nother years to examine the accretion flow, so we take a new approach to characterizing confusion.\\nTo correct for the flux bias attributed to Sgr A* for epochs when a known star is within the confusion limit, we\\nsubtract a value informed from simulations of stellar confusion with Sgr A*. We injected synthetic stars near Sgr A* in\\na series of five unconfused images from 2014-05-19 with characteristic data quality (Strehl ratio ∼0.27) and median Sgr\\nA* flux levels ( ∼0.1 mJy), noting that our results are relatively insensitive to these choices within the uncertainties. In\\neach set of images, we planted stars at distances from 0-100 mas (randomly oriented) and K′brightnesses from 14-18\\nmag, then ran Starfinder on the simulated images. See Figure 12 for sample images from our injection procedure. By\\nsubtracting out the known unconfused flux of Sgr A* from our detected value, we are able to obtain an estimate for\\nthe photometric bias induced by the stellar injections. The results of this procedure can be found in Table 7. We also\\nmeasure the position of Sgr A* and report the astrometric biases in Table 8. For injections below 60 mas, the source\\nand Sgr A* are almost always detected as a combined source, making the confusion correction reliable. However, from\\n∼60-80 mas, Sgr A* and the injected star are sometimes detected together, individually, or not at all–with varying flux\\ndensities in each case. While no confusion corrections for 60-80 mas were needed in this study, future studies should\\ntreat this range with care by determining whether Starfinder is detecting Sgr A* and the confused star separately\\nor together. Beyond 80 mas, Sgr A* is unambiguously detected with photometric biases consistent with zero, so no\\ncorrections are needed for stars at these distances.\\nFor the observation epochs affected by stellar confusion, we determined the distance of the confusing star from Sgr\\nA* by performing an orbital fit to aligned images of the Galactic center and obtaining the predicted distance at the\\n19\\nFigure 10.\\nSample observed Kslight curves of Sgr A* displaying bright flux excursions.

Given the brightness of the star and its distance, we interpolated\\nthe star-planting results in Table 7 to obtain the flux bias to subtract from the data. The epoch-wise corrections we\\napplied are given in Table 9, and the flux distributions of affected data before and after correction are shown in Figure\\n13. This procedure overcorrects and yields negative flux values in only a small percentage of frames. The corrections\\nslightly increase the photometric uncertainties to ∼20% for low fluxes, and high flux uncertainties are typically less\\nthan 5%. In this work, we have excluded epochs in which the bright star S0-2 falls within 60 mas of Sgr A* (July\\n2017-2018), as the uncertainties on S0-2’s flux bias correction are comparable to faint Sgr A* flux levels. Starfinder\\nreliably detects S0-2 and Sgr A* as distinct sources in the remaining data.\\nThere is likely an unresolved stellar component that contributes to the measured flux densities, but we are unable\\nto disentangle this effect from temporal variations of the Sgr A* baseline flux in this study. However, these unresolved\\nstars are faint by nature and expected to only slightly shift the median flux density between epochs.\\nI.STRUCTURE FUNCTION ANALYSIS\\nTo convert between the structure function slope βand PSD slope α, we generate 103light curves with the respective\\ntime sampling and fixed PSD slope α, then measure the structure function slope β. This procedure is repeated for\\n20\\nFigure 11.\\nSample of faint Kslight curves of Sgr A*. Dashed lines show the 95th and 50th percentile flux values from the historical\\ndistribution.

See Figure 14 for the relationships between αandβthat we find from the simulations. We perform\\na linear fit to these values to make the conversion between structure function slope and PSD slope in the data.\\nIn Table 3, we found a shallower PSD slope for the 2020-2022 data compared to the pre-2019 and 2019 data. To\\ndetermine whether a greater white noise component in the post-2019 data is responsible for this shallower slope, we\\nsimulate 103light curves with the post-2019 time sampling assuming an intrisic PSD slope of α= 2.5, then add varying\\nlevels of white noise and fit for a measured value of α(a procedure performed in Do et al. 2019). We find in Figure\\n15 that as the ratio of white noise to red noise becomes ≲10, a flatter PSD slope is indeed measured. As a result, the\\nwhite noise contamination from the stars S0-61 in 2021 and S0-38 in 2022 could have caused a shallower value of αto\\nbe measured for these years.\\n21\\nFigure 12.\\nSample images from our star injection routine. The upper left image shows the central 0.5” ×0.5” of a Galactic center frame\\nfrom 2014-05-19 with no artificial star injected. This frame was chosen for its typical data quality (Strehl ratio ∼0.27), typical\\nSgr A* brightness of K= 16.8 mag, and Sgr A* being relatively unconfused by known stars. In the remaining images above,\\naK= 16.5 mag star is injected into the images with respective distances from Sgr A* labeled and random orientations. We\\nthen ran our PSF fitting program Starfinder on each image to determine the photometric bias in our measurement of Sgr A*’s\\nflux. This procedure was repeated for five similar frames and the average values of the photometric bias induced by the injected\\nstars are displayed at the bottom of each image. As a general trend, the photometric bias decreases with increasing distance.\\nWe repeated this procedure for injected star brightnesses ranging from K= 14−18 mag.\\n22\\nTable 7.

From 2005-2009 (blue), we\\nmake corrections for S0-104 and S0-102. In 2021-2022 (orange), we make corrections for S0-61 and S0-38. We see that the distributions\\nare shifted to lower flux densities upon removal of the photometric bias. Despite reflecting different epochs that are affected by confusion\\nfrom different stars, these two corrected flux distributions appear to be quite similar.\\nFigure 14. 1σbands for the measured structure function slope βwith input PSD slope αfor simulated light curves with the time\\nsampling of the pre-2019 (blue), 2019 (black), and post-2019 (orange) observations.
