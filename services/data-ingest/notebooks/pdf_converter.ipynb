The current highest redshift quasar host detected3, at z = 4.5, required the magnifying effect of a foreground lensing galaxy. Low-luminosity quasars4,5,6 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) 7 mitigate the challenge of detecting their underlying, previously-undetected host galaxies. Here we report rest- frame optical images and spectroscopy of two HSC-SSP quasars at z > 6 with JWST. Using NIRCam imaging at 3.6µm and 1.5µm and subtracting the light from the unresolved quasars, we find that the host galaxies are massive (stellar masses of 13× and',\n",
       "  847],\n",
       " ['pdf3.pdf',\n",
       "  '3.4× 1010 M⊙, respectively), compact, and disk-like. NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy shows stellar absorption lines in the more massive quasar, confirming the detection of the host. Velocity-broadened gas in the vicinity of these quasars enables measurements of their black hole masses (1.4 ×109 and 2.0× 108 M⊙, respectively). Their location in the black hole mass - stellar mass plane is consistent with the distribution at low redshift, suggesting that the relation between black holes and their host galaxies was already in place less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The quasars J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 (coordinates listed in Extended Data Table 1) are at redshifts of 6.40 and 6.34. They have relatively low luminosity (M1450 = −23.87 and −23.66 mag, respectively), roughly 10 times less luminous than typical bright quasars at these redshifts 8,9,10. Using JWST with NIRCam11, we observed J2236+0032 on November 6, 2022 and J2255+0251 on October 26, 2022. Images were taken in two broad-band filters (F356W and F150W) to detect their host galaxies at 3.56 and 1.50µm, thus bracketing the rest-frame 4000 Å break, a characteristic feature of galaxy spectra which constrains the age of the stellar population. Total exposure times were approximately 3,100 seconds for each filter per target. In Figure 1, we show a 24′′×24′′ region and zoomed-in cutouts of the JWST images centered on the quasars for both filters. As expected, both quasars are detected at high significance. The first quasar J2236+0032 ( mF356W = 21.75 ±0.02 mag, mF150W = 22.78 ±0.02,) has no evidence of close neighbors. The second quasar J2255+0251 ( mF356W = 22.20 ±0.02 mag, mF150W = 23.03 ±0.02) has 2 two neighboring sources (< 2.6′′) that do not have spectroscopic redshifts at this point; however, their detection in the HSC r- and i-bands suggests that both of them are at lower redshift than the central quasar. The detection of an underlying host galaxy requires careful decomposition of the two-dimensional light distribution to separate the unresolved quasar from its host galaxy. We perform a two-component model fit of the rest-frame optical emission in a region of the NIRCam images centered on each target. We use the software galight12 to identify stars from each image to model the two-dimensional (2D) point-spread function (PSF). We then model each quasar image in each filter as a sum of',\n",

       "  'a point-like quasar and an extended host. The host galaxy was modeled using a 2D Sérsic profile 13 whose parameters include the position, size (Reff), axis ratio, orientation, flux, and the radial profile/shape of the light distribution (i.e., Sérsic index), allowing a flexible description of the a prioriunknown host galaxy shape. In Extended Data Table 1, we report the best-fit parameters and their uncertainties based on the dispersion resulting from different PSF models with different modeling techniques (see Methods). As shown in Figure 2, we detect the host galaxies for both targets, which are visible after subtracting the quasar point-source model (third column). For J2236+0032, the quasar host is significantly detected in both filters (mF356W = 23.12 ±0.20 mag; mF150W = 25.12 ±0.29 mag). The inferred host-to-total flux ratios are 25.5 ±4.4%, and 10.2 ±2.8% with sizes (Reff) of 0.7 ±0.1 kpc and 0.5 ±0.2 kpc for F356W and F150W, respectively. The light distribution is elongated in the same direction (i.e., NE–SW) in the two filters, suggesting a mildly inclined disk-like host. For this target, we fix the Sérsic index to 1 in both bands – corresponding to an exponential disk model – to avoid non-physical fits; this is supported by a subsequent fit to the host galaxy emission after subtracting the quasar (see Methods). For J2255+0251, the host galaxy is clearly detected in the F356W band (mF356W = 24.58 ±0.30 mag) with a host-to-total flux ratio of 9.8 ±2.6%. The host emission extends southeast (left) of the quasar’s location. The size of the host is inferred to be Reff= 1.5 ±1.1 kpc with a Sérsic index of 1.5 ±1.4, suggesting a more disk-like than spheroidal profile. The host galaxy is not detected in the F150W image, resulting in an upper limit of mF150W = 26.3 mag (see Methods). This upper limit provides an important constraint on the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED). A non-detection is not surprising, given the low host-to-total flux ratio in the F356W band and the fact that galaxies are typically fainter blueward of the 4000 Å break. We use NIRSpec14 observations to demonstrate that the contribution of extended line emission to the host photometry in F356W is minimal (See Methods). Our two photometric bands lie on either side of the 4000 Å break, allowing us to quantify the contributions',\n",

We fit the SED of each host with a single stellar population, in which the stellar metallicity logZ/Z⊙ is constrained to the range [−1,−0.3], the stellar age is within the range[0.01,0.84] Gyr (capped by the age of the universe at redshift 6.4), and the extinction A v is in the range of [0,5.0] mag. With standard assumptions on the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF), we find that J2236+0032 has a stellar mass of 1.3+2.0 −0.6 ×1011 M⊙, while J2255+0251 is less massive with 3.4+7.6 −1.9 ×1010 M⊙. We use simulations and three different SED fitting codes to demonstrate that the results are robust, although further observations will lessen potential systematic errors in these mass estimates (see Methods for full details on our mass estimates and their uncertainties). Our host galaxies are among the highest stellar mass galaxies known at z ∼ 6 (ref. 15). A rest-frame optical spectrum of each quasar was obtained by the NIRSpec instrument on JWST (Figure 3). These spectra cover 2.87–5.27 µm, or approximately 4000–7000 Å in the rest-frame, revealing strong emission lines including the Hβ+[O III ] multiplet, Hα, and blended Fe II pseudo-continuum. The 0.′′2-wide slit was fortuitously aligned along the major axis of the host galaxy of J2236+0032 (Figure 2). Remarkably, we serendipitously identify stellar absorption lines (Hγ, Hδ, and Hε) in J2236+0032. Thus the contribution of stellar light is confirmed both from the imaging and spectroscopy in this object. We 3/27 use the velocity width of the broad Hβ emission line and the rest-frame 5100 Å continuum luminosity to estimate the mass of the central black hole, under the assumption that the high-velocity gas is governed by the gravity of the SMBH. Using a recipe calibrated in the local universe16 and subtracting the stellar emission, we obtain virial masses of MBH = 1.4 ×109 M⊙ for J2236+0032, and MBH = 2.0 ×108 M⊙ for J2255+0251, respectively (see Methods). Figure 4 shows the two z ∼ 6.4 quasars in the black hole mass – stellar mass plane (left panel), as well as the inferred underlying relation compared to the local relation (right panel). As is observed in the local universe, the quasar hosting the more massive black hole',\n",

To evaluate their location in the MBH – M∗ plane relative to the local mass relation, we carry out a simulation, following ref. 17, that takes into account the selection effects for these two quasars in the HSC survey. For this purpose, we combine the quasar flux limits, the estimated BH mass and accretion rate functions at z ∼ 6, as well as uncertainty in our stellar mass estimates to predict the expected M BH for these two quasars – under the baseline assumption that the MBH–M∗ relation does not evolve between z = 6.4 and the present. In the left panel, the orange contours show the resulting bivariate probability distribution for the location of these two quasars, with the measured values overplotted in red. Our two z > 6 quasars fall within the probability distribution (orange contours) of this simulated z ∼ 6.4 sample and are thus consistent with no evolution of the M BH–M∗ relation from z ∼ 6.4 to z = 0, as shown for the inferred underlying relation in the right panel of Figure 4. With just two quasars, the probability distribution of the nominal evolution strength is broad as suggested by the width of these uncertainties (see also Extended Data Figure 6 in the Methods). However, ongoing JWST observations will give us a significantly larger sample, allowing us to better constrain models for the mutual evolution of the black hole and stellar populations in galaxies18,19,20.

The quasars exhibit broad Lyα emission and strong intergalactic medium absorption blueward of Lyα. This deep survey, which is sensitive to quasars a factor of 10 less luminous than those discovered by shallower surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (see Extended Data Figure 1). NIRCam Observations and data reduction The data presented in this paper were taken with Module B of the NIRCam instrument, which has a field of view of 2.2 ×2.2 square arcminutes. Total exposures of 3,100 seconds in the two filters (F356W and F150W) were obtained simultaneously. A 4 ×4 primary and sub-pixel dithering pattern was employed to mitigate cosmic ray hits and bad pixels in the detector and to ensure sub-pixel resampling during the stacking step. We used the INTRAMODULEBOX and STANDARDdithering patterns for the primary and sub-pixel dithers, respectively. We used theBRIGHT1 readout mode. The data were processed using the standard procedures in JWST pipeline version 1.7.2. The pre- calibrated “Stage 2” image frames were downloaded from the MAST archive. These images have the pipeline parameter reference files jwst_1009.pmap for J2255+0251 and jwst_1011.pmap for J2236+0032, as registered in the JWST Calibration Reference Data System1. For individual frames, global background light was first subtracted using the Background2D function of Photutils24. The archived images clearly have horizontal and vertical stripe noise patterns, known as “1/ f noise”. This 1/ f noise was subtracted by first masking bright objects, then collapsing the 2D images along each axis of the detectors and estimating the noise amplitudes by measuring sigma-clipped median values. These amplitudes were then subtracted from each row and column. The horizontal stripes were measured for each of the four detector amplifiers separately. These post-processed Stage 2 image frames were then aligned and stacked with inverse-variance weighting using the Stage 3 pipeline, keeping the original position angle of the detector for the purpose of building the PSF library. Both F356W and F150W images were resampled with a pixel scale a factor of two smaller than that of the detector, using the drizzling algorithm implemented in the Resample step of the pipeline. The final pixel scales for F356W and F150W are 0.′′0315 and 0.′′0153, respectively. 2D image decomposition of quasar and host galaxy emission using galight Accurate decomposition of',\n",

       "  'the image of a quasar into a central point source and an extended host galaxy requires a high-quality model for the PSF based on stars detected in the same image as the quasars. Space-based telescopes have a much sharper and more stable PSF than ground-based telescopes, and the Hubble Space Telescope(HST) has been used to measure quasar host galaxies to redshift up to z ∼ 2 (ref. 12,25,26,27). However, HST’s ∼90-minute orbit means that it is continually passing between Earth’s 1https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu 10/27 shadow and direct sunlight, causing the telescope to expand and contract (“orbital breathing”) and giving rise to a time-dependent PSF. The difficulty of modeling the PSF has not allowed quasar host galaxies to be detected significantly beyond z ≳ 3 (ref. 1,2,28,29), where host starlight can be only measured through the SED fitting method30. Here, we follow our tested strategy 12, including the analysis of JWST images 32, and build a PSF library by identifying all isolated, unsaturated stars of sufficient signal-to noise ratio (SNR) in our images. We identified 12 |16 PSF stars in filter F150W |F356W for J2236+0032 and 9 |5 PSF stars in filter F150W|F356W in the images for J2255+0251. We use our two-dimensional modeling software galight12 to fit the quasar images with a model of a scaled PSF (the spatially unresolved point-like quasar) and a PSF-convolved 2D Sérsic profile (the host galaxy). galight is a python-based open- source package2 that utilizes the image modeling capabilities of lenstronomy31. It has been adopted for quasar decomposition of images by HST12, JWST32, and the HSC survey33. We adopt uniform priors for the effective radius Reff ∈ [0.′′03,2.′′0] and the Sérsic index (n) ∈ [0.3,9] of the host to avoid unphysical parameter inference. For J2255+0251, there is one nearby object which we fit simultaneously with a Sérsic profile, allowing us to correct for its effect on the host galaxy properties. We obtain a weighted inference for the decomposition result as briefly described here. After subtracting the remaining local background, we use each PSF in our library in turn to fit the image. The performance of each PSF is determined by its best-fit χ2 value. We select groups of two, three, and five PSFs from the library that have the top level χ2 performance and then average them using psfr (Birrer et al.',\n",
       "  596],\n",
       " ['pdf3.pdf',\n",
       "  'in prep). To optimize our modeling of the unresolved quasar emission, we consider both best-fit models using individual stars and average models based on the combined PSF stars described above. Thus, we add the three averaged PSFs as new members to the PSF library. We take the results from the five top-performing PSF models in the updated library. We determine our final result parameters by weighting their χ2 values, as defined by ref. 12, Eq. (3)-(6). The uncertainties we quote are based on the dispersion in the host properties from these five different PSF models. Errors based on variation in the PSF models are often significantly larger than the formal fitting errors, as has been recently demonstrated using simulations and observations of quasars and their host galaxies 34. The final inferred host filter magnitude, size, Sérsic index, and other fit parameters are presented in Extended Data Table 1. The images in Figure 2 are based on the PSF with the best performance. The sizes of our host galaxies are defined using the Sérsic effective radius Reff along the semi-major axis measured by galight. The quasar host of J2236+0032 appears to be a compact galaxy. As a result, we find that the Sérsic n is poorly constrained, and the resulting host residual is point-like with an inferred Reff of 0.′′03 (the lower limit of the prior), indicating that the central PSF has not been fully removed. This model implies a stellar mass with an implausibly high value above 1011.8 M⊙ given the SED fitting described below. Thus, we refit this object, fixing n = 1 in both F356W and F150W. This gives a much-improved model. The host is quite elongated in F356W, suggesting that it is a disky edge-on galaxy. We also find a consistent position angle between F356W and F150W, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, for J2236+0032, we adopt the results with Sérsic n fixed to 1. We further directly fit the “data − quasar\" residual image (i.e., host) with the Sérsic model and allow the Sérsic index to vary. When we do so, the inferred n is 1.55 with values of Reff and the host magnitude consistent with those with the n = 1 fit. Since J2255+0251 has no clear host detection in the F150W band, we re-model the data and fix',\n",

We still see no evidence for a host residual, but the model gives a formal host magnitude of 26.3 ±0.2 mag. We quote these inferences 2https://galight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 11/27 in Extended Data Table 1 and adopt a lower limit to the magnitude of 26.3 mag. Confirmation of our 2D decomposition using galfit In the fitting routine described above, the results are sensitive to the setting of certain parameters. For instance, a sub-pixel shift of the PSF is typically needed to optimally align with the position of the quasar. This interpolation within a pixel can result in modest variations in the allocation of flux between the quasar and its host galaxy. In galight, the parameter point_source_supersampling_factor controls this interpolation. For guidance here on the optimal setting, we compared our results with the decomposition from galfit35 while implementing different supersampling factor values, i.e., 1 (no interpolation) and 2. The choice of supersampling factor had a greater impact on the F150W decomposi- tion than that on the F356W image. We found that the two codes are in close agreement when using a supersampling_factor of 2 as shown in Extended Data Figure 2 and reported in Extended Data Table 1. As a result, to account for the uncertainty associated with this setting, we report the averaged results obtained using both supersampling_factor values of 1 and 2, with uncertainties covered by these two settings. Tests of the robustness of the host galaxy properties We perform several sanity checks for our two quasars to confirm that the detections of their host galaxies are real. First, our final reduced data are co-added using 16 dithers. To check whether the apparent host is caused by a random ghost from any particular dither frame, we reanalyze the data using the first 8 and the second 8 dithers separately. We are able to detect the host from both halves of the data. To ensure that the apparent host galaxy flux is not dominated by a mismatched PSF core, we mask the quasar center (using a 0.′′12 and 0.′′06 radius aperture for F356W and F150W, respectively) and redo the fit. Again, the host is well-detected. To rule out',\n",

       "  'the possibility that the residual emission (host galaxy) is an artifact of the chosen PSF stars, we selected the five top-performing PSF in the library, and identified twenty pairs from these. We then fit one PSF with the other without assuming any host component for all pairs. We performed this test for stars in the fields of J2236+0032 and J2255+0251 in both bands; residual images show no extended features in any case. This is illustrated for J2255+0251 in the F356W filter in the top panels of Extended Data Figure 3. We also fit galaxy + host models to pure PSF images, in which case the inferred host magnitudes were roughly two magnitudes fainter than the hosts detected around the quasars. In contrast, we clearly detect the quasar host when we use any of the five library PSFs and, using these stellar residual maps to measure the standard deviation, we display the maps of the host signal-to-noise ratio for all images of our two quasars in the bottom panels of Extended Data Figure 3. We carried out three sets of simulations to further validate our host detections, including J2255+0251 in the F356W filter and J2236+0032 in the F356W and F150W filters. In one realization of the simulation, we randomly select a PSF from the five top-ranked PSFs in the library, and add a Sérsic profile using the best-fit parameters from our model inference. We sample the resulting mock quasar+host image at the observed resolution and insert it into a random empty position in the JWST NIRCam data. We then model the images with the other four PSF stars, and select the result with the best performance. We repeated this simulation a hundred times to quantify the bias and standard deviation of the inferred values around the true values. We found that the key Sérsic parameters can be obtained accurately, with biases well below 1σ in all quantities. For J2255+0251, the bias (obtained−truth) and scatter of the inferred host magnitude are −0.02±0.11. For J2236+0032, the magnitude bias and scatter are 0.01 ±0.14 and −0.13±0.16 for F356W and F150W, respectively. We present the distributions of the inferred host magnitudes in the simulations of J2255+0251 (F356W) in Extended Data Figure 4. We note that these simulation tests were 12/27 conducted with point_source_supersampling_factor set to 1. The similar scatter',\n",

We fix the host galaxy parameters for J2236+0032 (where the host is detected in F150W), setting the Sérsic parameters to those inferred from F356W; we find a very similar host magnitude to the value when all parameters are allowed to vary: the changes in the inferred host magnitude are within 0.1 mag. Stellar mass of the host galaxy We use SED fitting to estimate the stellar masses of our two host galaxies at z ∼ 6.4 using the photometry and its uncertainty based on NIRCam imaging with two filters (F356W and F150W) which straddle the rest-frame 4000 Å break. The host galaxy of J2255+0251 is not detected in the F150W filter, thus we take 26.3 mag as a lower limit on the magnitude. We adopt a Chabrier IMF in our analysis to allow direct comparison with the local black hole - host galaxy mass relations (e.g., ref. 21,22). Contributions of nebular emission lines from the host galaxies are also allowed with a uniform log ionization parameter logU over the range[−3,−1]. Three key parameters define the shape of the SED template: age, metallicity, and dust attenuation (A v). We adopt a uniform prior on the age over the range [0.01, 0.84] (in Gyr), extending to the age of the universe at z = 6.4. We adopt a uniform prior in metallicity logZ/Z⊙ over the range [−1,−0.3] following ref. 36,37. We assume an Av range of [0, 5.0] mag for both targets. For J2255+0251, the F150W band has an upper limit on the flux thus the constraint on Av is weaker; hence, we assume Av follows a log-normal distribution with a median value at 0.85 as supported by recent JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies38. A measurement of the Balmer decrement (i.e., the ratio of narrow Hα and Hβ in the spectrum) implies an attenuation Av=0.67±0.13 mag for the narrow-line region (Onoue et al., in prep), consistent with the median extinction value of our prior. We also note that for J2236+0032, the contribution of the host in the spectrum (Onoue et al., in prep) has a magnitude in close agreement with the NIRCam photometry, supporting our stellar mass estimate.',\n",

       "  'We use gsf39 to perform the SED model fitting. This software generates a set of templates with a range of ages and metallicities according to the prior to fit a composite stellar population (CSP)-like star formation history. A random parameter sampling is performed through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) to infer the probability distribution of the SED parameters. For J2236+0032 and J2255+0251, the inferred values of log M∗ are 11.12+0.40 −0.27 and 10.53+0.51 −0.37 (in units of M⊙), respectively, as shown in Extended Data Table 1. In Extended Data Figure 5, we present the best-fit SEDs of the two quasar hosts, in which the MCMC inference indicates that the stellar mass is mildly sensitive to age and metallicity but is more sensitive to Av. We also adopt the same configuration for the independent code Bagpipes40 and CIGALE41 to perform SED fits; we find values of M ∗ that change by 0.1 dex or less. The robust measurement of stellar mass is due to having photometry on both sides of the 4000 Å break, accurate spectroscopic redshifts, and a firm upper limit of the stellar age 0.84 Gyr, given the age of the universe at z = 6.4. Even so, we note that additional systematic uncertainties may be unaccounted for thus leading to greater uncertainty in the mass estimates than we have quoted. NIRSpec Observations and data reduction The NIRSpec Fixed-Slit data for the two quasars were obtained on October 30, 2022 for J2236+0032 and October 28, 2022 for J2255+0251. The targets were aligned onto the 0.′′2 ×3.′′2 S200A2 slit and observed with the medium-resolution (R ∼ 1000) G395M grating, which covers 2.87 – 5.27 µm in the observed frame. Total exposures of 1,970 seconds were obtained for each target. The spectroscopic data were processed with the JWST pipeline version 1.8.5. Raw ( uncal) data were downloaded from the MAST archive, which has the parameter reference files jwst_1027.pmap. 13/27 The stage 1 calibration was performed with the default parameters but with the function to detect large cosmic-ray hits on the detector turned on during the Jump step. The 1/ f noise along the vertical direction was subtracted from the Stage 1 products using the same method as that for NIRCam images.

During the Stage 2 data processing, including flat-fielding and flux calibration, we use in-flight measurements of spectrophotometric standard stars (jwst_nirspec_fflat_0065.fits) to convert the detector signals into physical units. The signal loss due to the optical system and the finite width of the S200A2 slit were corrected in the Pathloss step by applying built-in correction factors for a point source as a function of wavelength. The two-dimensional spectra at each dither position were then stacked using the Stage 3 pipeline. The pixel resampling scale was kept to the original pixel scale of the detector. A 6-pixel-wide box-car aperture (0.′′6 wide) was employed to extract the one-dimensional spectrum from the stacked spectrum. Spectrum fitting We use a public code QSOFitMORE42 (version 1.2.03) with custom modification to fit the NIRSpec rest-optical spectra of the two quasars. The continuum emission is fitted with two components: power-law emission from the accretion disk, and a pseudo-continuum from the forest of singly-ionized iron emission. QSOFitMORE uses an empirical iron template of ref. 43. The rest-frame 5100 Å monochromatic luminosity (L5100) is derived from the best-fit power-law continuum model with a power-law index ofαλ (i.e., flux density Fλ ∝ λαλ ). Emission lines are modeled with a combination of one or more Gaussian profiles. J2236+0032 needs one broad component for Hβ, while the adjacent forbidden emission of [O III ] λλ 4960,5008 requires one narrow component and another blueshifted broad component. The narrow [O III ] doublet is forced to have the same line width without velocity offsets between the two. The [O III ] redshifts of the two targets are derived from the peaks of the narrow [O III ] components. The [O III ] redshift of J2236+0032 agrees well with the location of the absorption lines we detect in Hγ, Hδ, and Hε (Figure 3). The Hβ+[O III ] line profile as well as the continuum properties of J2236+0032 are reported in Extended Data Table 2. A full description of the fitting procedure and other emission line properties will be presented in Onoue et al. (in prep.). BH mass estimates The central black hole masses MBH of the two quasars are measured by the single-epoch method using broad Hβ emission lines. Assuming that the broad Hβ emission traces the kinematics of the gas orbiting in the vicinity',\n",

       "  'of the SMBHs (the so-called broad-line-region), one can use the line width of Hβ as a proxy of the rotation velocity of the broad-line-region gas. There is also an empirical correlation between the rest-frame 5100 Å continuum luminosity (L5100) and the radius from the SMBH to the broad-line-region gas, which is observed by the reverberation mapping technique44. In this paper, we use the recipe provided by ref. 16 to estimate the black hole mass: MBH = 106.91 \\x12 L5100 1044 erg s−1 \\x130.50 \\x12 FWHMHβ 103 km s−1 \\x132 M⊙. (1) Based on the spectrum fitting results described above, we derive virial BH masses of MBH = (1.54 ± 0.27) ×109 M⊙ for J2236+0032 and MBH = (2.02 ±0.17) ×108 M⊙ for J2255+0251. Note that these 3https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4893646 14/27 virial SMBH masses have intrinsic uncertainties of 0.4 dex16, which is not included in the error budget above. We report the derived BH properties in Extended Data Table 2. We estimate the host galaxy contribution to the rest-optical continua of the NIRSpec spectra, using the decomposed host galaxy images in the NIRCam’s F356W filter. Referring to the relative position angle of the NIRCam and NIRSpec observations, we find that the stellar emission falling inside the 0.′′2 ×0.′′6 extraction aperture is 21.8% (J2236+0032) and 4.8% (J2255+0251) with respect to the total emission. We interpret this as the fraction of the host starlight in the observed continuum emission in the NIRSpec G395M spectrum for each source, which allows us to correct the 5100 Å continuum luminosity to that from the quasar emission alone. Accordingly, the virial BH masses become MBH = (1.36 ±0.15)×109 M⊙ for J2236+0032 and MBH = (1.97 ±0.17)×108 M⊙ for J2255+0251, respectively. These corrected BH properties are reported in Extended Data Table 2, and are adopted in Figure 4. This correction is more significant for J2236+0032, in which stellar absorption lines are detected (Figure 3). Emission from Hβ+[O III ] in the hosts Our SED model allows for the inclusion of the Hβ+[O III ] line emission that falls within the F365W filter (Extended Data Figure 5). However, if those lines were of high equivalent width in the hosts, they could affect the broad-band photometry used in the stellar mass inference, especially if the gas is ionized by the quasar45,46. To ensure that our NIRCam',\n",

       "  'detection of extended host emission is not dominated by these lines, we directly compare the total flux of the Hβ+[O III ] narrow lines seen in our spectra with the contribution from the host in the NIRCam image within the aperture of the spectral slit. For J2236+0032, narrow Hβ emission is not detected and the [O III ] emission in NIRSpec contributes only ∼ 3% of the host galaxy light. For J2255+0251, the narrow Hβ+[O III ] emission is comparable to the host galaxy brightness measured in the F356W filter. Much of this emission may be coming from the narrow-line region of the quasar itself. To quantify the impact on the detection of the stellar continuum, we use the 2D NIRSpec spectroscopic data and fit a Gaussian to the unresolved spatial profile at each wavelength, allowing the centroid to vary linearly with wavelength, setting the width to be the same as the spatial PSF as measured from a publicly available reference star in the same spectroscopic configuration as our observations, and letting the amplitude be a free parameter. The best-fit Gaussian profile at each wavelength is then subtracted from the 2D spectrogram to reveal any spatially extended [O III ] emission in the spectrum. A background region of equivalent size is subtracted from the extended emission region. We calculate the flux density of the extended emission in the F356W band and compare it to the flux density of the NIRCam host galaxy within the aperture of the NIRSpec slit on the sky. For J2255+0251, the [O III ] extended emission has a magnitude of 27.6, which is 11% of the flux of the observed host galaxy within the slit aperture. Note that the measurement of the extended emission is based on the observational fact that the apparent minor axis of J2255+0251 is wider than the scale of the PSF in F356W (see Figure 2). We thus conclude that the majority of the narrow Hβ+[O III ] emission in J2255+0251 comes from the unresolved quasar, which has been removed by our quasar decomposition. For J2236+0032, we use the same approach and find that the extended [O III ] has a magnitude of 27.5 mag. The flux ratio between the extended [O III ] and the host galaxy within the slit is ∼ 3%.

       "  'Hβ emission was detected in either target. Construction of mock quasar and host galaxy sample at z = 6.4 We use the method described in ref. 17 to generate mock samples to assess the expected location of our two quasars in the black hole - stellar mass plane. We start with a large galaxy sample representative of the population at z ∼ 6 based on the stellar mass function15. We then assume that the ratio of black hole to host stellar mass and its dispersion are the same as the local values (i.e., no evolution). As an update on 15/27 this procedure, we now use the BH Eddington rate distribution of ref. 47 to assign quasar luminosities. Observational uncertainty on M∗ and intrinsic uncertainty on MBH are incorporated with a selection on magnitude (−23.9 < M1450 < −23.8) is applied. The orange contours in Figure 4 show the resulting bivariate probability distribution in the stellar mass-black hole mass plane. We further generate samples for different evolution rates (MBH/M∗ ∝ (1 +z)γ ) in steps of 0.1 in γ and under the assumption that the dispersion is the same as the local value (ref. 17,48 demonstrates that the evolution rate and dispersion are degenerate). The probability distribution of γ is determined given our measurements of both MBH and M∗ of our two quasars (Extended Data Figure 6); γ lies in the range −0.40 to +0.84 with 68% confidence. 23.

All rights reserved Keywords quasar, supermassive black hole, galaxy evolution, cosmic reionization Abstract Quasars at cosmic dawn provide powerful probes of the formation and growth of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the uni- verse, their connections to galaxy and structure formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the epoch of reioniza- tion (EoR). Hundreds of quasars have been discovered in the ﬁrst billion years of cosmic history, with the quasar redshift frontier extended to z∼7.6. Observations of quasars at cosmic dawn show that: • The number density of luminous quasars declines exponentially at z >5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerge at z ∼10; the lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution indicates a rapid buildup of the AGN environment. • Billion-solar-mass BHs already exist at z >7.5; they must form and grow in less than 700 Myr, by a combination of massive early BH seeds with highly eﬃcient and sustained accretion. • The rapid quasar growth is accompanied by strong star formation and feedback activity in their host galaxies, which show diverse mor- phological and kinetic properties, with typical dynamical mass of lower than that implied by the local BH/galaxy scaling relations. • HI absorption in quasar spectra probes the tail end of cosmic reionization at z ∼ 5.3 −6, and indicates the EoR midpoint at 6.9 < z <7.6, with large spatial ﬂuctuations in IGM ionization. Observations of heavy element absorption lines suggest that the circumgalactic medium also experiences evolution in its ionization structure and metal enrichment during the EoR. 1 arXiv:2212.06907v1 [astro-ph.GA] 13 Dec 2022 Contents 1.

Introduction Quasars, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in general, are powered by accretion onto the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of their host galaxies. Quasars are the most luminous non-transient sources in the Universe, and have been observed up to a redshift of z ∼7.6 (Wang et al. 2021b). SMBH activities are a key ingredient of galaxy formation. Quasars provide crucial probes of galaxy evolution and cosmology across cosmic history at three critical spatial scales: 1. At the scale of the AGN central engine ( <1pc), quasar emission originates from well within the SMBH sphere of inﬂuence, at which the gravitational inﬂuence of the BH dominates. Quasars are fundamental in understanding the physics of BH accretion and growth and the physics of AGN activity. 2. At the scale of quasar host galaxies ( ∼1 −10 kpc), the evolution of quasars and galaxies are strongly coupled, as shown by the tight correlation between SMBH mass and the mass/velocity dispersion of their host galaxies seen at low redshift (e.g, the M-σ relation, Kormendy & Ho',\n",

       " ['pdf2.pdf',\n",
       "  '2013). Quasars are key to understand the assembly, 2 Fan et al. growth and quenching of massive galaxies. 3. At the scale of galaxy clusters and superclusters ( >Mpc), quasars can be used to probe the growth of early large scale structure. They also provide sightlines to study the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM), including the history of cosmic reionization, the chemical enrichment of the IGM, the distribution of baryons and the evolution of ionization state of the IGM, and its connection to galaxy formation through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The history of quasar studies is driven and shaped by innovations in systematic surveys and multiwavelength observations of quasars. These observations aim to reaching higher redshift, covering the full range of quasar luminosities, and spatially resolving quasar hosts and their central AGN structure. Studies of high-redshift quasars within the ﬁrst few billion years of cosmic history started with the advent of large area digital or digitized sky surveys, highlighted by progress made using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al. 2000), which resulted in the ﬁrst detections of quasars at z >5 and z >6 (Fan et al. 2001). Observations of z ∼6 quasars in the early 2000s provided fundamental insights in the three key scales of galaxy evolution mentioned above: 1. SMBHs with masses up to a few billion M⊙ already existed in the Universe within one billion years after the Big Bang, requiring a combination of early massive BH seeds and rapid BH accretion. 2. Early luminous quasars are sites of intensive galaxy-scale star formation and the assembly of early massive galaxies. 3. Detection of strong IGM absorption in quasar spectra, especially the emergence of complete Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs (Gunn & Peterson 1965) shows a rapid transition of the ionization state of the IGM at z∼5 −6, marking this epoch as the end of cosmic reionization. In this review, we will focus on the progress since then, including the quests for the earliest quasars, and the detailed studies of quasars during and right after the epoch of reionization (EoR). We will limit our discussions to: (1) the redshift range of z > 5.3; this is the lower redshift limit at which there are still detectable signatures of reionization activity. This redshift corresponds to 1.1 Gyr after the',\n",

At the time of this review, JWST has started routine observations, and initial JWST results have begun to appear in the literature. We will not include any early JWST results in this article. JWST observations of high-redshift quasars will undoubtedly provide many new insights that will result in discoveries and challenges that should be the subject of a future review. There have been a number of excellent Annual Review articles on related topics which we will not repeat: Inayoshi et al. (2020) reviewed topics related to the initial BH seeds and early growth; Kormendy & Ho (2013) presented a very detailed discussion of BH/galaxy co- evolution; Carilli & Walter (2013) reviewed early (pre-ALMA) sub/mm observations of high- www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 3 redshift galaxies; including quasar hosts.

This review is organized as follows: In Section 2, we will review the progress in searching for the highest redshift quasars and in establishing large sample of quasars at cosmic dawn, as a result of the new generations of wide-ﬁeld sky surveys and the developments in data mining and machine learning. In this Section, we will present a database of all published Type-1 quasars at z > 5.3. In Section 3, we will discuss the evolution of quasars as a population at high redshift, and present the measurements of quasar luminosity function, and the trend in the evolution of quasar intrinsic properties in early epochs. We will also highlight special populations of high-redshift quasars. In Section 4, we will discuss the use of high-redshift quasars as probes to the history of SMBH growth in the early Universe, and review statistics of measurements of quasar BH masses and accretion characteristics.

In Section 6, we will review the the progress in using IGM absorption in quasar sight lines and properties of quasar proximity zones to probe the history of cosmic reionization and IGM chemical enrichment. Throughout this review, we assume a spatially ﬂat LCDM cosmological model with Ωm = 0.3 and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, consistent with the ﬁnal Planck results. 2. THE QUASAR REDSHIFT FRONTIER Advances in the studies of high-redshift quasars are ﬁrst and foremost driven by advances in high-redshift quasar surveys and new discoveries. The quasar redshift frontier continues to expand as a result of new sky surveys: the ﬁrst quasar discoveries at z >4 in the 1980s were made possible by digital or digitized large sky surveys and the ﬁrst implementations of color drop-out selection techniques (e.g., Warren et al. 1987). After the SDSS discoveries of the ﬁrst z >5 (Fan et al. 1999) andz >6 (Fan et al. 2001) quasars in the early 2000s, wide-ﬁeld near-infrared (NIR) sky surveys in the following decade, such as UKIDSS (Lawrence et al. 2007) led to the detection of the ﬁrst quasars at z >7 (e.g., Mortlock et al. 2011), deep into the EoR. At the time of this review, the quasar redshift frontier stands at z = 7.64 (Wang et al. 2021b). Meanwhile, increasingly large samples of high-redshift quasars are established by continued mining and systematic spectroscopic followup observations based on these new surveys. Currently, about 1000 quasars have been discovered at z >5, and more than 200 at z >6. 2.1. Progress in High-Redshift Quasar Surveys Surveys of the highest redshift quasars face three technical challenges. First, quasars at cosmic dawn are among the rarest objects in the Universe. The ﬁnal SDSS z ∼6 quasar sample covers more than 11,000 deg 2, but contains only 52 quasars (Jiang et al. 2016). Their discoveries require large surveys that cover a signiﬁcant fraction of the sky. The second challenge is often referred to as “ﬁnding needles in a haystack”. Most high-redshift quasar surveys are based on Lyman break dropout selections using optical',\n",

       " ['pdf2.pdf',\n",
       "  'and NIR pho- tometric survey data. However, other populations of celestial objects, in particular cool galactic dwarfs with spectral types M, L and T (usually referred as MLTs) and compact 4 Fan et al. early-type intermediate-redshift galaxies, have similar optical and NIR colors. Barnett et al. (2019) show that these contaminant populations outnumber z∼7 quasars by 2–4 orders of magnitude in deep photometric surveys. A number of photometric selection techniques have been developed, and the choices of how to apply these techniques require careful consider- ation of the balance between selection eﬃciency and completeness. Finally, spectroscopic identiﬁcations of candidate quasars require observations on large aperture telescopes. Until recently, such observations were only possible with single-object spectroscopy because the low spatial density of high-redshift quasars. The demand of telescope resources for discovery drives the need for both high selection eﬃciency and sometimes special observing strategies. For example, Wang et al. (2017) improved spectroscopic identiﬁcation eﬃciency by using low-resolution (R ∼300) long-slit NIR spectroscopy, which could capture the prominent Lyman break features in the quasar spectra and reject contaminants with shorter exposure than higher resolution spectra, which is more common for quasar spectroscopy followup work, would require. 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 Redshift −28 −26 −24 −22 −20 M1450 (UV magnitude) 2019 ≤ year ≤ 2022 2016 ≤ year < 2019 2000 ≤ year < 2016 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 Year 0 200 400 600z ≥ 5.3 quasars Total = 531 Figure 1 Distribution of all known z≥ 5.3 quasars in the absolute magnitude-redshift plane (top panel).

At z >3, the strong IGM neutral hydrogen (HI) absorption from Lyman series lines and Lyman continuum redshifts into the observed optical wavelength. Thus high-redshift quasars are “dropout” objects with a strong Lyman break with the dropout bands correspond to the observed wavelength of the Lyman break. At longer wavelength, quasars have blue broad-band colors due to their power law contin- uum. The Lyman dropout selection method for quasars has been used since the discoveries of the ﬁrst z >4 quasars (Warren et al. 1987). A more recent development is the inclusion of mid-IR (MIR) photometric surveys in the candidate selection (e.g. Wu et al. 2015). The long wavelength baseline from NIR to MIR, in particular using the WISE (Wright et al. 2010) data, allows more eﬀective separation of high-redshift quasars and MLT dwarfs by colors. 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 y−J 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 J−W1 6.06.5 7.0 7.2 M L T Figure 2 Example of y−J vs. J−W1 color-color diagram used for high-redshift quasar selections.

Fig. 2 illustrates how to use the combination of optical and IR colors to select z >6.5 quasars. At z∼6.5, the strong Ly α emission line is in the y band. At higher redshift, this band starts to be dominated by IGM absorption and quasars become “y-dropouts” with increasing red y−J colors. Meanwhile, the J−W1 color is determined by the quasar power law continuum and has a near constant value, which is redder than most of the sub/stellar objects with spectral types earlier than L. The main contaminants for this redshift range are L and T dwarfs. Inayoshi et al. (2020) presented a summary table of the photometric surveys used in',\n",

       "  'the discoveries of z >6 quasars in the past ﬁfteen years. Early surveys such as SDSS and PS1 (Chambers et al. 2016) used 2–4 meter class telescopes with relatively short exposure 6 Fan et al. times, thus they are optimized to discover rare, luminous quasars in large sky areas. Se- lection of fainter quasars requires photometric observations on large aperture telescopes: the SHELLQs project (Matsuoka et al. 2022) is based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope (Aihara et al. 2018). As shown in Fig 2, at z >7, quasars begin to drop out in the y band at the red limit of CCD detector sensitivities. The discovery of quasars at this redshift requires the combination of wide-ﬁeld IR surveys that provide detection of the quasar rest-frame UV continuum, and deep optical surveys that sample the strong Lyman break. Following the ﬁrst quasar discovery at z >7 using photometric data from the UKIDSS survey (Mortlock et al. 2011), there have been eight quasars published at z >7 (see Table 1). The current redshift frontier is represented by the three luminous quasars known at z >7.5, selected using a combination of NIR, optical, and MIR (WISE) surveys: J1342+0928 at z = 7 .54 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2018); J1007+2115 at z = 7.52 (“P¯ oniu¯ a’ena”, Yang et al. 2020b); and J0313-1806 atz = 7.64 (Wang et al. 2021b). 2.2. Optimization of Photometric Selection of High-Redshift Quasars The vast majority of high-redshift quasars have been discovered using color selection. The most commonly used method is to implement a series of “color cuts”: select objects that meet a set of criteria in the ﬂux/ﬂux-error space (usually referred to as the “color space”) as high-redshift quasar candidates. These cuts are often initially guided by a combination of photometry of existing high-redshift quasars and simulated colors based on synthetic quasar spectra, as well as observed and simulated data of the contaminant populations. These cuts are reﬁned as surveys progress with larger training sets and better understanding of the contaminant populations. Fan (1999) presented an early example of color space simulation of diﬀerent populations of objects with compact morphology (quasars, normal stars, white dwarfs and compact galaxies) in the SDSS photometric system. This simulation was used to formulate color selections for both the SDSS main',\n",

       "  'spectroscopic survey (Richards et al. 2002) and selections of z∼6 quasars (Fan et al. 2001). Works such as Hewett et al. (2006), McGreer et al. (2013), Barnett et al. (2019), and Temple et al. (2021) expanded these simulations by including more realistic quasar population models and models of MLT and intermediate-redshift galaxies, extending to higher redshifts, and including NIR and MIR photometric bands. High-redshift surveys based on SDSS (e.g., Jiang et al. 2016), PS1 (e.g., Ba˜ nados et al. 2016) as well as works using the DESI Legacy Survey (e.g., Wang et al. 2019) used color cuts as their primary selection method. The color cut method is simple to implement, and has high selection completeness even for objects that have unusual spectral features such as broad absorption lines (BALs), weak emission lines or those with modest reddening, because the color cuts are usually fairly loose and cover a large portion of color space, and the strong Lyman break is not strongly aﬀected by the intrinsic quasar SEDs. On the other hand, because all candidates that satisfy the cuts are selected without considering the relative density distribution of the targeted (quasar) population and the contaminant populations (primary MLTs and compact galaxies), or how the candidate SEDs match the quasar template, color cut selection tends to have a higher contamination rate. For example, Wang et al. (2019) ﬁnd a 30% spectroscopic success rate when searching forz >6.5 quasars. The contamination grows signiﬁcantly worse forz∼7.5 (F. Wang, private communication). A number of techniques have been applied to improve the eﬃciency of color selection. www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 7 These improvements are especially important for quasars at the highest redshift ( z >6.5), where quasars are increasingly rare compared to the contaminant populations, and at fainter ﬂuxes for which increasing photometric errors results in more contaminants scatter into the selected area in color space. Mortlock et al. (2012) ﬁrst introduced a selection algorithm based on Bayesian model comparison (BMC). In BMC, the posterior quasar probability for a given object with survey photometry d is given by : Pq = p(q|d) = Wq(d) Wq(d) + Wb(d) + Wg(d), 1. where q, b, and g represent quasar, brown dwarf (MLTs), and galaxy populations, re- spectively.

(2011) to data from the UKIDSS survey to identify the ﬁrst quasar atz >7. The SHELLQs survey (Matsuoka et al. 2022) used BMC to select faint quasars in the HSC survey with great success in achieving a high spectroscopic identiﬁcation rate ( ∼75%) even at the low-luminosity end at z ∼6. Wagenveld et al. (2022) presented a similar probabilistic approach that also includes radio data in the selection. Reed et al. (2017) applied a SED ﬁtting method for high-redshift quasar selection. In this method, after the initial color cuts, reduced χ2 values are calculated for each candidate, matching the observed colors of the candidate observed SEDs to a series of model SEDs, including diﬀerent MLT spectral types as well as early type galaxies at various redshifts. Objects with high reduced χ2 for the contaminant populations, and low values for the quasar SED models are selected as quasar candidates. Barnett et al. (2021) presented a detailed comparison study of diﬀerent selection tech- niques in searching for z >6.5 quasars using VIKING survey data. They show that BMC is highly complete in recovering previously known quasars in the survey area, and at the same time eﬀectively rejects conﬁrmed contaminants. Using simulations, they calculate the survey selection function – completeness as a function of quasar redshift and luminosity, and ﬁnd that both BMC and the SED method represent a signiﬁcant improvement in selection completeness and depth compared to simple color cuts. Wenzl et al. (2021) used a random forest supervised machine learning method to select z >5 quasars from PS1 data with high eﬃciency. Nanni et al. (2022) proposed an alternative probabilistic approach, in which the density of the contaminant populations in color space is modeled as Gaussian mixtures based on observed photometric data and calculated using the extreme deconvolution technique, instead of using simulated population models. High-redshift quasar selection can also be considered in the context of supervised ma- chine learning. The training sets of existing objects are small, and in most case are subject to the bias of previously selected samples or extrapolations from low-redshift populations. The choice of high-redshift quasar selection algorithm in a given survey is a tradeoﬀ',\n",

An example is the discovery of J0100+2802, the most luminous unlensed quasar currently known at z >5 (Wu et al. 2015). The object was assigned as low priority in the original SDSS survey due to its relatively red color and bright apparently magnitude, indicating high probability of it being a brown dwarf. It is not surprising that record-breaking discov- ery is made often – but not always (e.g., Mortlock et al. 2011) – using the less restrictive 8 Fan et al. color-cut method, and probabilistic methods are more eﬀective once a large training set has been established. If high-redshift quasar candidates could be part of the overall target selection in a large automated spectroscopic survey program, then the color selection could be relaxed to be more complete and less sensitive to templates or model assumptions, because high-redshift quasar candidates are rare and are thus only a small fraction of the total targets. The SDSS main quasar survey (Richards et al. 2002) targeted quasars up to z∼5.4. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI, Abareshi et al. 2022) is using spectrographs with 5000 ﬁbers on the 4-m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak to conduct a 5-year spectroscopic survey of ∼40 million galaxies, quasars and stars. DESI is expected to more than double the number of quasars known at z >5 when completed. A similar survey is being planned for the 4MOST project (Merloni 2019). Other established quasar selection methods include variability, astrometry (i.e., lack of proper motion; Lang et al. 2009), detections in X-ray and radio wavelengths, MIR colors, as well as wide-ﬁeld slitless spectroscopy. Except for the last method (e.g., Schneider et al. 1989, 1999), most selection methods are not sensitive to the quasar redshifts. Therefore, some color cuts are usually used to identify high-redshift quasar candidates. McGreer et al. (2006) and Zeimann et al. (2011) report the ﬁrst discoveries of radio-loud z > 6 quasars by matching radio surveys such as FIRST with optical photometric surveys. X-ray observations provide fundamental probes of AGN evolution across cosmic time.

We include a database with their basic properties in the Supplementary Materialassociated with this review (follow the Supplemental Material link from the Annual Reviews home page at http://www.annualreviews.org). To be included in this database, we require the object to : (1) have a spectroscopically conﬁrmed redshift z ≥ 5.3; we do not include objects with only photometric redshifts; (2) have at least one broad emission line (FWHM > 2000 km s −1) in the rest-frame UV; we do not include narrow-line (Type-2) quasars or obscured AGN at high redshift. In addition to the quasar name, coordinates, redshift and references, the database also include measurements of the quasar’s continuum luminosity at the rest-frame 1450 ˚A and 3000 ˚A, properties of the Mg ii emission line, and BH mass derived from Mgii measurements quoted in the literature, estimated using Equation 4. We only consider Mg ii measurements for quasars at z >5.9, as Mg ii lines are usually in regions highly aﬀected by telluric absorption in the NIR at lower redshift. The high-redshift quasar database includes 275 objects at z >6 and 8 at z >7. At the time of writing, there are 113 z >5.9 quasars with robust Mg ii-based black hole mass estimates. We list the properties of quasars currently known at z >7 in Table 1. This database expands the compilation in the Supplementary Material of Inayoshi et al. (2020).

It will cover 15,000 deg 2 of the sky to a 5 σ depth of 24 mag in Y, J and H bands (Scaramella et al. 2022), enabling selection of quasar candidates up to z ∼10. Barnett et al. (2019) predicted that Euclid + LSST will allow discoveries of ∼25 quasars at z >7.5, including ∼8 beyond z >8, although the exact yields strongly depend on the assumed evolution of quasar luminosity function. Further in the future is NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will cover a smaller area in its High Latitude Survey but reaching about two magnitude deeper. Fan et al. (2019a) show that by extrapolating the current measurement of the quasar luminosity function, there will be only one “SDSS”-like quasar ( M1450 <−26, powered by billion-M⊙SMBH) over the entire observable universe at z >9. The combination of LSST, Euclid and Roman will allow the discovery of the earliest luminous quasars in the Universe. However, in addition to the challenges of their selection (Barnett et al. 2019, Nanni et al. 2022), their spectroscopic identiﬁcation will require IR spectrographs more powerful than those with the current ground-based telescopes: 30m-class extremely large telescopes and JWST will be the primary tools for their conﬁrmation and follow-up observations. 3. AN EVOL VING QUASAR POPULATION In this section, we ﬁrst review the evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at high redshift, which directly constrains the growth history of early SMBHs (Sec 3.1). The number density of quasars is found to decline rapidly towards high redshift, in sharp constrast to the lack of strong evolution in the SEDs of quasars (Sec 3.2), from X-ray to radio, and in particular in the rest-frame UV to NIR, at which the quasar SED peaks, although a number of sub-types of quasars appear to be more common at z >5 −6. www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 11 3.1.

Osmer (1982) presented the ﬁrst evidence that quasar density at z >3.5 appears to be declining. Schmidt et al. (1995) characterized this decline as an exponential function with redshift: ρ(z) ∝10kz, 2. where k is measured to be ∼−0.5 at z∼3 −5. The shape of the QLF is usually described as a double, or broken, power law: Φ(M1450,z) = Φ∗(z) 100.4(α+1)(M1450−M∗ 1450) + 100.4(β+1)(M1450−M∗ 1450) 3. where M1450 is the absolute magnitude of the quasar continuum at rest-frame 1450˚A, αand β are the faint-end and bright-end slopes, respectively, M∗ 1450 is the characteristic absolute magnitude or break magnitude measured at 1450 ˚A, and Φ∗is the normalization of the LF which has an exponential decline described in Eq. 2. Early high-redshift surveys such as the SDSS were only sensitive to the most luminous quasars. Based on a sample of nine SDSS quasars at z >5.7, Fan et al. (2004) found that at z∼6, the co-moving spatial density of quasars with M1450 <−26.7 is 6 ×10−10Mpc−3, consistent with extrapolation from lower redshift trends. Jiang et al. (2009) extended the SDSS quasar survey to the “stripe 82” region, reaching two magnitudes deeper than the SDSS main survey. They found a bright end slope β between –2.6 and –3.1. Willott et al. (2010) combined the faint quasars discovered in the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS) with the brighter SDSS quasars, and presented the ﬁrst measurement of QLF at z∼6 using a sample of 40 quasars. They found a bright end slope β = −2.81 and a break magnitude M∗ 1450 = −25.1; the faint end slope was still poorly constrained at this redshift. Jiang et al. (2016) presented the ﬁnal results of the z ∼6 quasar survey in the SDSS footprint. Using this sample of 52 quasar at 5 .7 <z <6.4, they found a bright end slope of β = −2.8 ±0.2. In addition, they found a density evolution with the exponential evolution parameter k = −0.72 ±0.11, a signiﬁcantly steeper slope than the value at z ∼3 −5, suggesting an accelerated evolution of luminous quasars between z∼5 and 6.

(2018) presented measurements of the QLF down to M1450 ∼ −22, which is well ﬁt with a double power law that has a faint-end slope α= −1.23+0.44 −0.34, a bright-end slope β = −2.73+0.23 −0.31, and a break magnitude M∗ 1450 = −24.90+0.75 −0.90. Their measured QLF showed a strong break and a signiﬁcant ﬂattening at the faint end at z ∼6. Schindler et al. (2022) used the combination of the bright PS1 quasar sample that includes 125 quasars at z ∼5.7 −6.2 with the fainter quasars from SHELLQs for a new QLF measurement at z ∼6. They found a steeper bright-end slope of β = −3.84+0.63 −1.21, as well as a steeper faint-end slope of α = −1.70+0.29 −0.19, with a bright break magnitude of M∗ 1450 = −26.38+0.79 −0.60. Their study yields a constant redshift evolution of k∼−0.7 over a wide redshift range of z= 4 −7. Measurement of the QLF becomes increasingly diﬃcult at higher redshift due to the rapid decline in spatial density of quasars. Wang et al. (2019) conducted the ﬁrst mea- surement of the QLF at redshift approaching seven based on a sample of 17 quasars at 12 Fan et al. 6.45 < z <7.05 (see also Venemans et al. 2013). They found a quasar spatial comoving density of ρ(M1450 <−26) = 0.39 ±0.11Gpc−3 at z∼6.7, and an exponential density evo- lution parameter k= −0.78 ±0.18. The density of luminous quasars declines by a factor of ∼6 per unit redshift. The e-folding time of quasar density evolution and that of black hole accretion (Sec 4) become comparable, underlying the strong constraints quasar evolution could place on the SMBH accretion mode. −28−26−24−22 M1450 (mag) 0.001 0.010 0.100 1.000 10.000 Φ( M1450, z) (Gpc−3mag−1) Jiang + 2016 Matsuoka+2018 Schindler+2022 Willott + 2010 Jiang + 2016 Matsuoka+2018 Schindler+2022 (binned) 2 4 6 Redshift 100 101 102 n (M1450< −26, z) (cGpc−3) Kulkarni + 2019 k = −0 .7 k = −0 .78 Giallongo + 2019 Matsuoka + 2018 Jiang + 2016 Wang + 2019 Schindler+2022 6.0 6.5 7.0 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 Figure 4 Quasar luminosity function measurements at high-redshift.

Figures adapted from Schindler et al. (2022). Fig 4 (right panel) illustrates the overall density evolution of luminous ( M1450 <−26) quasars with measurements from various surveys at z= 3 −7. While a strong exponential decline in the comoving spatial density of luminous quasars has been well established, there are still signiﬁcant uncertainties in the evolution of the shape of the QLF (Fig 4, left panel). As discussed in Schindler et al. (2022), the bright-end slope determination is strongly inﬂuenced by small number statistics. At the faint end, selection incompleteness could be a signiﬁcant factor when a completeness correction of ≳ 2 is often needed. There have been a number of ambitious eﬀorts to combine QLF measurements across the electromagnetic spectrum and diﬀerent cosmic epochs to obtain a complete picture of quasar/AGN evolution from reionization to the current epoch. Hopkins et al. (2007) presented the bolometric QLF up to z∼6. They explicitly modeled the X-ray column den- sity distribution and SED shape variation of quasars to allow determinations of bolometric luminosities of high-redshift populations. Kulkarni et al. (2019) constructed a sample of more than 80,000 color-selected quasars and AGN with a homogeneous treatment of survey selection eﬀects, and derived the AGN UV luminosity function from z = 0 to 7.5. Their measurement suggested a continued steeping of the faint end slope β and a brightening of the break magnitude. Shen et al. (2020) updated the early Hopkins et al. work. They found bolometric QLF evolution consistent with those based on UV-selected samples alone, and concluded that the faint-end slope measurement is still uncertain at high-redshift. www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 13 For the purpose of comparison with theoretical models or making predictions of future surveys, we suggest using the combined QLF measurements presented in Kulkarni et al. (2019) or Shen et al. (2020) for z≲ 6, where the QLF is well measured over a wide range of luminosity. At z ≳ 6, the uncertainty is still large for both the QLF shape and its redshift evolution; Schindler et al. (2022) presented the most up-to-date measurements.

Kato et al. (2020) reported the discovery of two dust-reddened quasars at z >5.6 in the SHELLQs survey based on their mid-IR WISE detection. Endsley et al. (2022) discovered an obscured radio- loud AGN at z= 6.85 in the 1.5 deg2 COSMOS ﬁeld with bolometric luminosity comparable to that of luminous SDSS z ∼6 quasars. Ni et al. (2020) studied the obscuration of high redshift quasars using the BLUETIDES simulation, and predicted that the dust-extincted UV LF is about 1.5 dex lower than the intrinsic LF, and the vast majority of z∼7 AGNs have been missed by UV-based surveys due to dust extinction. This would imply a much higher bolometric luminosity density of early quasars, and would have a profound impact on the growth of SMBHs and early galaxy evolution overall. A reliable determination of the obscured fraction of quasars at z ≳ 5 needs a combination of wide-ﬁeld deep X-ray survey and eﬀective spectroscopic identiﬁcation of faint, obscured sources with either JWST or NOEMA/ALMA. 3.2. (A Lack of) Evolution of the Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions High-redshift galaxies have intrinsic blue SEDs that are dominated by young stellar popu- lations. Metallicity, or chemical abundance, in their ISM has also been shown to be lower than in low-redshift galaxies (Stark 2016). However, the overall SEDs and the chemical abundance in quasar broad line regions (BLRs) do not evolve signiﬁcantly with redshift, al- though quasar density decreases drastically at high-redshift. This apparent lack of spectral evolution in the UV properties of quasars were noticed as soon as the ﬁrst z ∼6 quasars were discovered (e.g., Barth et al. 2003, Fan et al. 2004, Iwamuro et al. 2004, Jiang et al. 2007). Shen et al. (2019) conducted an optical/NIR spectroscopic survey of 50 quasars at z >5.7. Their observations covered the wavelength range from the Ly α to Mg ii emission lines. Yang et al.

There is no evidence of evolution in the Fe/Mg ratio up to the highest redshift, although scatter is large at any given redshift (Fig 5). The lack of spectral evolution in quasar rest-frame UV spectra, especially in the emission line properties, indicates that quasar BLRs are chemically enriched very rapidly, within the ﬁrst few hundred million years after the initial star formation in the host galaxy. This is not surprising, as we will review in Sec 5: quasar host galaxies are sites of the most intense star formation in the early universe. However, there are a few noticeable evolutionary trends in quasars at cosmic dawn that could be related to the early phase of quasar growth. In Sec 5.4, we discuss an increasing fraction of quasars with strongly blue-shifted high ionization UV emission lines and with strong BAL features as evidence for early quasar feedback. In Sec 6.3.1, we present the discovery of z∼6 quasars with IGM absorption features indicative of very young ages. A subset of high-redshift SDSS quasars have much weaker UV emission lines, in par- www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 15 ticular Lyα and C iv. Diamond-Stanic et al. (2009) identiﬁed them as >3σ outliers in the quasar emission line strength distributions. They represent ∼1% of quasar population at z <4, after correction for selection incompleteness (Diamond-Stanic et al. 2009). Ba˜ nados et al. (2016) showed that this fraction increases to ∼14% among z >5.6 PS1 quasars based on Lyαmeasurements. Shen et al. (2019) found a similar fraction using C iv measurements. It remains unclear whether weak line quasars are related to the young age or high accretion rate in the high-redshift quasar population (Plotkin et al. 2015).. X-ray emission originates from the accretion disk and surrounding hot corona close to the central SMBH, and provides crucial information about black hole accretion and AGN feedback (Fabian 2012). Brandt et al. (2001) detected the ﬁrst z∼6 quasar in X-rays using the XMM/Newton telescope. More than 30 quasar at z ≳ 6 have now been detected in X-rays, using either the Chandra or XMM-Newton telescopes. Nanni et al. (2017) analyzed 29 quasars at z >5.5 with X-ray detections.

(2019a) carried out a similar analysis, and found a slightly steeper X-ray power-law index, consistent with a generally higher Eddington ratio among SMBHs in these quasars at z >6. Wang et al. (2021a) extended the X-ray analysis to quasars at z ∼7 (see also Pons et al. 2020). They also found a steepening of X-ray spectra with Γ ∼2.3. The optical-X-ray power-law slope, αOX, traces the relative importance of the accretion disk and corono emission in quasars and AGN. At low redshift, there is a tight correlation between αOX and the quasar UV luminosity (e.g. Just et al. 2007). There is no evolution in this correlation up to z ∼7 (e.g. Wang et al. 2021a). The X-ray observations show a consistent picture that the inner accretion-disk and hot-corona structure in quasars was established at the highest redshift with minimal evolution in their properties across cosmic time. At rest-frame NIR and MIR wavelengths, the radiation from quasars is dominated by reprocessed emission from the hot dust component beyond the accretion disk structure (see review by Lyu & Rieke 2022). At the highest redshift, dust observations (at rest-frame >1.5 µm) have been largely limited to photometric observations of bright sources using the Spitzer (e.g., Jiang et al. 2006) and Herschel (Leipski et al. 2014) Telescopes, although this will change with the launch of JWST. These observations also showed a lack of evolution: the average IR-SEDs of quasars at z ∼5 −6 are consistent with low-redshift templates and the hot dust structure is already in place by z ∼6. Jiang et al. (2010) reported the detection of two quasars at z∼6 with weak hot dust emissions using Spitzer. Later studies suggested that these dust-deﬁcient quasars are not unique to z >6, and examples with similar SEDs are found even in the low-redshift PG sample (e.g. Lyu et al. 2017). Quasars were initially discovered as point-like sources emitting strong radio emissions (Schmidt 1963). However, the fraction of quasars that exhibit strong jet-powered radio emission (radio-loud quasars) is around 10% with no signiﬁcant dependence on redshift, at least up to z ∼6 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2021, Gloudemans et al.',\n",

       "  '2021). The highest redshift radio-loud quasar known is at z = 6 .82 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2021), and the highest redshift blazar is at z = 6.10 (Belladitta et al. 2020). It is still debated whether the seemingly constant radio-loud fraction is due to two intrinsically diﬀerent populations of quasars or is a consequence of the duty cycle of jet emission during the life of a quasar. If the latter were the case, one should expect an increase in the radio-loud fraction at the highest redshifts (where the available time for a quasar shortens), something we have not yet witnessed and depends on the lifetime of the radio-loud phase. 16 Fan et al. The lack of evolution in the radio-loud fraction discussed above concerns the compact core radio emission. However, there is an important evolution with redshift if we focus on the extended radio emission: the lack of giant ( ∼100s kpc) radio lobes at z >4, which are common at lower redshifts (Fabian et al. 2014). Indeed, the most extended radio jet known at z ∼6 is < 2 kpc (Momjian et al. 2018). A plausible physical explanation is that at z >4, the CMB energy density [ ∝(1 + z)4] exceeds the magnetic energy density in radio lobes. In that case, inverse Compton (IC) scattering losses will make any large lobes at high redshift radio weak and X-ray bright (Ghisellini et al. 2014). The IC/CMB eﬀect has been challenging to probe with current X-ray telescopes. Recent deep Chandra X-ray observations of the two z ∼6 quasars with the most extended radio jets resulted in tentative evidence of larger X-ray jets (Connor et al. 2021, Ighina et al. 2022). Obtaining this marginal evidence was expensive, even for our most powerful X-ray telescopes observing the best existing targets to test this eﬀect. To robustly measure the IC/CMB eﬀect in a sample of radio-loud quasars, we will likely need to wait for the next generation of X-ray telescopes. The discussions in this subsection present a picture that on average, the intrinsic SED of quasars at the highest redshift, with emission from the accretion disk (X-ray, UV/optical), broad emission line regions, hot dust, and radio jets, show little evolution from their low- redshift counterparts. The AGN structure is already in place and fully formed up',\n",

JWST will enable detailed studies of the physical properties of high-redshift quasars in the rest-frame optical and IR wavelengths which are not possible from the ground. It will be especially interesting to see if the dust component of the quasar population shows any evolution, since dust production mechanism (e.g. Maiolino et al. 2004) and the ISM conditions in the host galaxies are likely diﬀerent in early epochs. X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM of even the most luminous quasars at cosmic dawn can only yield a small number of photons. Future X-ray missions (e.g. Martocchia et al. 2017) could allow allow high S/N spectroscopic observations of early quasars to characterize their accretion properties (including BH spin) and X-ray obscuration. 4. GROWTH OF SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES IN THE FIRST BILLION YEARS SMBHs are thought to be ubiquitous in the centers of massive galaxies, but their formation mechanism is still an outstanding question in astrophysics. Since the discovery of quasars at z ≳ 6 (Fan et al. 2001), the formation and growth of SMBHs have become even more intriguing and challenging to explain. In this section we will ﬁrst review the current methods used to measure the BH masses at high redshift (Section 4.1), then give an overview of the properties of the observed population (Section 4.2), and the implications for early BH seeds and growth (Section 4.3). Finally, we will brieﬂy describe additional methods that in the near future can be used to improve current BH mass estimates at high redshift (Section 4.4). 4.1. Black Hole Mass Measurements in High-redshift quasars The spectra of z ≳ 6 quasars show the typical signatures of broad (FWHM of thousands km s−1) emission lines that are superimposed on the power-law continuum emission of the quasar’s accretion disk. These broad lines are thought to emerge from a region very close www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 17 to the accreting BH (so-called the “broad-line region”) and thus provide a unique tool to constrain the properties of the central BH. The size of the broad-line region scales with the quasar luminosity, and the width of the lines is a measure of the potential depth (Peterson et al. 2004). Thus, a single-epoch spectrum gives enough information to estimate the mass',\n",

       " ['pdf2.pdf',\n",
       "  'of the central accreting BH (Vestergaard & Osmer 2009). One of the most reliable estimators of BH mass and Eddington ratio is the Hβline (e.g., Park et al. 2012). At z >6, Hβ is shifted to the MIR and is thus not accessible from the ground. As an alternative, the C iv λ1549 and Mg ii λ2800 lines have been extensively used to measure BH masses of quasars at these redshifts (e.g., De Rosa et al. 2014, Farina et al. 2022). Estimates based on the high ionization Civ line are uncertain, as this line shows large velocity oﬀsets, implying signiﬁcant non-virialized motions (Mej´ ıa-Restrepo et al. 2018, Park et al. 2017). Moreover, there is mounting evidence that large Civ blueshifts (>2000 km s−1) are more common at z >6 than at lower redshifts (e.g., Meyer et al. 2019, Schindler et al. 2020, see also Section 5.4). Therefore, in this review, we only focus on results based on Mg ii measurements, which are thought to be the most reliable until Hβ-derived masses are possible (Bahk et al. 2019; see Section 4.4). One of the most widely used relations for BH mass estimation in high-redshift quasars is: MBH = 106.86 [FWHM(Mg ii) 1000 km s−1 ]2 [ L3000 1044 erg s−1 ]0.5 M⊙, 4. where FWHM(Mg ii) is the Full Width at Half Maximum of the Mg ii line, and L3000 is the luminosity at 3000 ˚A. Vestergaard & Osmer (2009) presented the scaling relation from Equation 4. The intrinsic scatter in the relation is 0.55 dex, which dominates the uncertainty for individual measurements. The theoretical maximum luminosity that a source can achieve when the gravitational and radiation forces are in equilibrium is called the Eddington luminosity (Eddington 1926). The Eddington luminosity for pure ionized hydrogen in spherical symmetry is deﬁned as LEdd = 4πcGmpMBH σT 5. = 1 .26 ×1038 erg s−1 (MBH M⊙ ) where c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, mp is the mass of a proton, and σT is the Thomson scattering cross-section. The ratio between the bolometric and Eddington luminosities (referred to as Eddington ratio; λEdd = LBol/LEdd) is useful to assess the quasar population’s accretion properties. While several bolometric corrections are published in the literature (e.g., Runnoe et al. 2012, Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012, Duras',\n",

       "  'et al. 2020), in this review (e.g., in Fig. 6), we adopt the bolometric correction ﬁrst presented by Richards et al. (2006a) and used in several studies of high-redshift quasars (e.g., Shen et al. 2011, Yang et al. 2021, Farina et al. 2022): Lbol = 5.15 ×L3000, 6. Farina et al. (2022) argued that bolometric luminosities estimated using equation 6 are on average in between the ones calculated using the bolometric corrections from Runnoe et al. (2012) and Trakhtenbrot & Netzer (2012). In the high-redshift quasar database presented in Supplementary Material we report L3000 so the readers can apply their preferred bolometric correction. 18 Fan et al. 4.2. Current Demographics At redshifts 6 .0 ≲ z ≲ 7.6, the Mg ii line falls in the NIR K band. The vast majority of the Mg ii-based BH masses come from NIR spectra taken with powerful ground-based telescopes such as Gemini, VLT, Magellan, and Keck (Shen et al. 2019, Onoue et al. 2019, Yang et al. 2021, Farina et al. 2022). At the time of writing, there are 113 quasars at z >5.9 with reliable Mg ii-based black hole mass estimates. Currently, there is a strong bias towards luminous ( ≳ 1046 erg s−1) quasars, but obtaining reliable measurements for fainter sources is challenging with current facilities (see Onoue et al. 2019). We will need JWST and ELTs to enlarge the sample towards the faint end signiﬁcantly. Fig. 6 shows the bolometric luminosity and BH mass distribution for all quasars with Mg ii-based masses at z >5.9. The median BH mass is 1 .3 ×109 M⊙, while the least and most massive quasars are J0859+0022 at z= 6.39 (∼4 ×107 M⊙; Onoue et al. 2019) and J0100+2802 at z= 6.33 (∼1010 M⊙; Wu et al. 2015), respectively. The ﬁrst samples of NIR spectroscopic observations of ≳ 6 quasars showed that they accrete close to the Eddington limit, i.e.,λEdd ≈1 (e.g., Willott et al. 2003, Kurk et al. 2007, De Rosa et al. 2011). Extending the measurements to larger samples (Shen et al. 2019) or probing to fainter luminosities (Onoue et al. 2019) revealed a signiﬁcant number of quasars accreting at sub-Eddington rates. The recent works by Yang et al. (2021) and Farina et al. (2022) analyzed some of the largest samples of NIR spectra of z',\n",

       "  '≳ 6 quasars. Yang et al. (2021) studied 37 quasars at z >6.3 and found that these quasars have signiﬁcantly higher Eddington ratios (mean of 1.08 and median 0.85) than a luminosity-matched quasar sample at low redshift. Farina et al. (2022) studied the NIR spectra of 135z≳ 5.7 quasars (including BH properties derived from Mg ii and C iv), ﬁnding that at z ∼6 the Eddington ratio distributions are consistent with a luminosity-matched low-redshift sample independent of the luminosity, while there is evidence for a mild increase in the median Eddington ratios for z≳ 6.5 (in agreement with Yang et al. 2021). In our current compilation (Fig. 6), the Eddington ratio ranges from 0.08 to 2.70, with a median of 0.79 and a mean of 0.92. Forty quasars exceed the nominal Eddington limit, and eight have λEdd >2. These values must be considered with caution as there is a substantial scatter in the BH mass estimations (see Section 4.1). 4.3. Constraints on Early BH Seeds and Growth As shown in Fig. 7, the SMBHs powering the ﬁrst quasars have quickly grown to enormous sizes, and explaining this mass growth remains challenging. Assuming a 100% duty cycle, the mass of the SMBH would grow exponentially as: MBH(t) = MBH,seed ×exp [ (1 −ϵr)λEdd t tSal ] 7. where ϵr is the radiative eﬃciency, which is the eﬃciency of converting mass to energy and the Salpeter time is deﬁned as: tSal = ϵrσTc 4πGmp ≈ϵr450 Myr. 8.

Several potential theories have been developed to explain the existence of ∼ 109 M⊙ BHs at z < 6. However, for the current redshift records at z ∼ 7.5, at least under standard assumptions (i.e., Eddington-limited growth with ϵr = 0.1) only the heaviest “seeds” seem to be big enough to form these sources in such a short time, although they need to have sustained accretion their entire lifetime. For a thorough overview of the theoretical BH “seeds” we refer to the review by Inayoshi et al. (2020). Other alternatives not represented in Fig. 7 involve radiative ineﬃcient/highly obscured growth ( ϵr ≪0.1; Davies et al. 2019) or jet-enhanced accretion growth (Jolley & Kuncic 2008). According to Pacucci & Loeb (2022), the discovery of one ∼1010 M⊙black hole at z ≳ 9 would exclude the entire parameter space available for ∼100 M⊙seeds. However, it is important to note that these stringent constraints mainly apply to the most massive BHs at the highest redshift.

The shaded regions represent the mass ranges for popular BH seed formation scenarios (see Inayoshi et al. 2020). growth is no longer strongly limited by the available cosmic time. In other words, there could be multiple channels of SMBH growth, and the channel with massive seeds and high accretion rate is required only for the formation of the most extreme objects. 4.4.

Hβ BH masses are expected to be one of the ﬁrst results from the ﬁrst observations of high-redshift quasars with JWST. 4.4.2. Direct dynamical mass measurements. The unprecedented resolution provided by ALMA can spatially resolve the sphere of inﬂuence of central black holes in nearby galaxies, enabling direct gas-dynamical BH mass measurements (e.g., Cohn et al. 2021). The sphere of inﬂuence is the region where the SMBH dominates the gravitational potential; its radius is commonly deﬁned as r< GMBH σ2 10. where G is the gravitational constant, M BH is the mass of the BH, and σ is the stellar www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 21 velocity dispersion. For reference, the radius of inﬂuence of a 10 9 M⊙ SMBH in a galaxy with σ= 150 km s−1 is ∼190 pc. Obtaining a direct kinematic mass measurement of a SMBH at z >6 would be tremen- dously important to corroborate that the mass scaling relations used thus far (Eq. 4) still hold at the highest accessible redshifts. Recent ALMA observations of the [C ii] emission line in z >6 quasar hosts are approaching resolutions comparable to the expected sphere of inﬂuence of SMBHs (e.g., Walter et al. 2022). We anticipate that in the upcoming years, such measurement will be possible, at least for some selected objects, and this will be an active area of research with the ngVLA (Carilli & Shao 2018). 5. A MULTI WA VELENGTH VIEW OF QUASAR/GALAXY CO-EVOLUTION AT THE HIGHEST REDSHIFTS In the local Universe there are tight correlations between the mass of the central SMBHs and the stellar bulge of the galaxy (see review by Kormendy & Ho 2013). When and how these tight correlations arose is an open question. Constraints at the highest redshifts can provide essential clues when the time to grow a galaxy and BH is limited. Did the BH grow ﬁrst, and the galaxy follow? Vice versa? Or did they grow together? What are the main feedback mechanisms? How are the massive galaxies hosting quasars connected to their large-scale environment? In this section,',\n",

We will then give an overview of the eﬀorts to measure the stellar UV light from the z >6 quasar hosts and the recent successes in constraining their cold dust and gas via (sub)mm observations (Section 5.2). We will then discuss how we can use this information to constrain BH/galaxy co-evolution (Section 4.3) and describe observational evidence (or lack of) quasar feedback (Section 5.4). Finally, we will give an overview of the eﬀorts for using z ≳ 6 quasars as signposts for overdensities and large-scale structure in the early Universe (Section 5.5). 5.1. Quasar fueling - Ly αnebuale Enormous gas reservoirs are required to grow the SMBHs seen in the highest-redshift quasars continuously. Extended Ly α nebulae (also referred to as Ly α halos) trace the cold gas reservoirs likely feeding the central SMBH. In principle, such gas reservoirs are likely also star-forming regions (Haiman & Rees 2001, Di Matteo et al. 2017). The ﬁrst eﬀorts to look for these nebulae used narrow-band ﬁlters centered on the expected Lyαemission (e.g., Goto et al. 2009, Decarli et al. 2012, Momose et al. 2019) and through deep long-slit spectroscopy (e.g., Willott et al. 2011, Roche et al. 2014). The implications of these detections (as well as non-detections) were often diﬃcult to interpret due to slit and narrow-band ﬂux losses. Sometimes the same quasar observed with narrow-band imaging and long-slit spectroscopy yielded conﬂicting results. The search for these Ly α nebulae had a signiﬁcant step forward with the new Inte- gral Field Spectrographs (IFS) mounted on 8-m class telescopes, particularly VLT/MUSE. IFS enabled 3D morphology/kinematics of the Ly α halos (Drake et al. 2019). The most comprehensive search for Ly α halos to date is the REQUIEM survey (Farina et al. 2019), targeting 31 z >5.7 quasars with VLT/MUSE. REQUIEM revealed 12 Ly α nebulae with a range of luminosities and morphologies extending up to 30 kpc. Recently, Drake et al. 22 Fan et al. (2022) reported that the Ly α morphology and kinematics seem decoupled from the gas in the host galaxies as traced by [C ii] emission. This result might imply that the observed Lyα halos are being',\n",

       "  'powered by the central SMBH instead of tracing star formation, in line with recent simulations (Costa et al. 2022). Nevertheless, the resonant nature of the Lyαline makes it diﬃcult to disentangle the AGN/star-formation contribution completely. IFS observations of additional non-resonant lines (e.g., H α with JWST) will be needed to conﬁrm these results. 5.2. Quasar Host Galaxy Observations - Sites of Massive Galaxy Evolution Given the extreme luminosities and inferred BH masses of these quasars, we would expect that they reside in hosts with signiﬁcant stellar mass already in place (Kormendy & Ho 2013). However, the brightness of their central accreting BHs has prevented direct detection of the underlying starlight at (observed) optical and near-infrared wavelengths even with HST (e.g., Mechtley et al. 2012, Marshall et al. 2020). JWST’s unprecedented resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage should overcome most of the shortcomings of previous attempts, as Marshall et al. (2021) have demonstrated with simulations.

       "  'Assuming the dust heating came from starburst activity, this suggested enormous star formation rates of 100 −1000 M⊙yr−1. Therefore, these early studies showed that early SMBH growth can be accompanied by extended, intense star formation and large reservoirs of dense and enriched molecular gas. Rapid progress has been made in FIR observations of high-redshift quasar host galaxies with the advent of ALMA and major upgrades on the NOEMA interferometers (conveniently located in diﬀerent hemispheres). The greatest advances can be divided into three major areas: (i) sensitivity, (ii) resolution, (iii) multi-line tracers of the ISM. Sensitivity: The [C ii]158 µm ﬁne-structure line, which is the primary coolant of the cold neutral atomic medium, has become the workhorse for studies of z ≳ 6 quasar hosts. This was the natural choice as [C ii] is one of the brightest emission lines in star-forming galaxies and its frequency at z > 6 is conveniently located in a high-transmission atmospheric window visible with ALMA and NOEMA. [C ii] detections using the early generation of interferometers were challenging. By the time of the review of Carilli & Walter (2013), there were only two z ≳ 6 quasars with [C ii] detections, while now that number is ∼80. [C ii] line and IR continuum luminosities measurements provide independent estimates of SFR. Fig 8 shows a recent compilation of the [C ii] and IR luminosities and SFRs for z≳ 6 quasar hosts. Early ALMA results demonstrated its ability to study [C ii] emission from quasar hosts of both UV-bright and UV-faint z ≳ 6 quasars (Wang et al. 2013, Willott et al. 2013). These studies motivated the push to larger samples, marking the transition from studies of individual interesting sources to the ﬁrst statistical samples. Decarli et al. (2018) and Venemans et al. (2018) presented results from an ALMA snapshot survey of a large sample of luminous z∼6 quasars to study their FIR continuum and [C ii] properties. Remarkably, even with integration time of ≲ 15 min on ALMA, the detection rate is ≳ 90% for these quasars. They found typical [C ii] luminosities of 109 −1010 L⊙, FIR luminosities of 0 .3 − 13 ×1012 L⊙, and estimated dust masses of 107 −109 M⊙with star formation rates ranging from 50 to 2700 M⊙yr−1. ALMA also enabled detections of FIR continuum',\n",

Overall, there are only weak correlations between the bolometric luminosity of quasars (dominated by emission from accretion disk in the rest-frame UV/optical) and the FIR luminosity of the quasar hosts (dominated by star formation). Resolution: The unprecedented spatial resolution of ALMA allowed imaging of the ISM of z >6 quasar host galaxies at sub-kpc resolution for the ﬁrst time. The ﬁrst studies at kpc scales ( ∼0.2 −0.3′′) revealed interesting morphological characteristics. For example, Shao et al. (2017) found ordered motion in a z = 6.13 host that can be modeled with a rotating disk, Venemans et al. (2017a) report a remarkably compact ( ≲ 1 kpc) host galaxy at z= 7.08 that does not exhibit ordered motion on kpc scales, and Ba˜ nados et al. (2019a) showed that a galaxy merger hosts a z= 7.54 quasar. Venemans et al. (2020) presented a survey of 27 host galaxies at z ∼6 imaged at kpc scale with ALMA. They showed that the [C ii] emission in the bright, central regions of the 24 Fan et al. Figure 9 ALMA [C ii] observations of quasar hosts reveal diverse morphologies and kinematics (ﬁgure adapted from Neeleman et al. 2021). The top panel shows a dispersion dominated galaxy, the middle panel a galaxy consistent with a rotating disk, and the bottom panel shows a disturbed galaxy with an on-going merger. quasars have sizes of 1.0—4.8 kpc and are typically more extended than the dust continuum emission. The implied star formation rate densities at the center of these quasar hosts are a few hundred M⊙yr−1 kpc−2, below the Eddington limit for star formation (although there are examples of host galaxies forming stars at near the maximum possible rate, e.g., Andika et al. 2020, Yue et al. 2021b). Neeleman et al. (2021) modeled the kinematics of these 27 host galaxies. They found a large diversity in the quasar host properties. About 1/3 of the galaxies show smooth velocity gradients consistent with emission from a gaseous disk. About 1/3 have no evident velocity gradients, with their kinematics dominated by random motion. The ﬁnal 1/3 exhibit signatures of close companion interaction or galaxy merger activities (see Fig. 9 for examples). The highest',\n",

A key result of these morphological studies is that the population of host galaxies of luminous early quasars is diverse. While, on average, they are sites of massive galaxy assembly, they also appear to be in diﬀerent evolutionary phases.

Multi-line diagnostics: Even though the [C ii] emission line is important for redshift determination and gas dynamics (as discussed above), it cannot constrain the physics of the ISM by itself. A suite of emission lines tracing various phases of the ISM is required to characterize the physical conditions such as temperature, ionization, density, and metallic- ity. At the time of writing, this is an area of rapid development, and about a dozen quasar hosts have been detected in more than one tracer. Some of the main targeted lines (in addition to [C ii]) are: • The neutral carbon emission [CI] 369µm line, which traces the atomic medium in the external shells of molecular clouds (e.g., Yang et al. 2019a, Pensabene et al. 2021). • Two transitions of the [NII] line (205µm and 122µm), which is a pure tracer of the ionized medium and can be used to measure the fraction of [C ii] associated with the neutral',\n",

       "  'medium (e.g., Novak et al. 2019, Li et al. 2020). • The [OI] 146µm line, which is sensitive to the temperature of the atomic gas in the galaxy (e.g., Li et al. 2020, Meyer et al. 2022b). • The [OIII] 88µm line, which provides critical diagnostics for the conditions of star formation and the properties of massive stars (e.g., Walter et al. 2018, Hashimoto et al. 2019, Novak et al. 2019). 26 Fan et al. • Several rotational CO transitions: considered as the main probe of the molecular gas in dense star-forming regions (e.g., Gallerani et al. 2014, Venemans et al. 2017b, Novak et al. 2019, Decarli et al. 2022, Li et al. 2022b, Pensabene et al. 2021, Yang et al. 2019a) • Several water linesthat arise in the warm, dense phase of the interstellar medium and a number of OH molecular linesthat are usually associated with outﬂows of dense material (e.g., Yang et al. 2019a, Pensabene et al. 2021, 2022). A combination of these diﬀerent tracers yields molecular gas masses in the rangeMH2 ∼ 1010−1011 M⊙, and ISM metallicities comparable to the solar value. Generally, the observed luminosities are better modeled by photo-dissociation regions instead of X-ray-dominated regions (see the review by Wolﬁre et al. 2022). The current small sample of quasars with multiple ISM tracers is highly biased towards objects bright in [C ii]. We expect that the characterization of physical conditions of the ISM in early massive galaxies will be expanded to much larger samples. 5.3. Constraints on Galaxy Mass and Black Hole/Galaxy Co-Evolution Dynamical masses of the quasar hosts can be measured using spatially and kinematically resolved line observations (see Section 5.2). The dynamical mass enclosed within a radius R is typically expressed as: Mdyn = v2 circ G R, 11. where G is the gravitational constant and vcirc is the maximum circular velocity of the gas disk. Obtaining vcirc is not trivial, as it requires knowing the inclination angle of the galaxy. Estimates of dynamical masses combined with robust BH masses (Section 4.1) make it feasible to push BH/galaxy co-evolution studies to the highest accessible redshifts. Wang et al. (2010) measured dynamical masses using CO emission from 8 quasar hosts at z∼6. Assuming an average inclination angle of 40◦and R= 2.5 kpc, they found that the z ∼6 quasars',\n",

       "  'have, on average, SMBHs a factor 15 more massive than expected from the local BH – bulge mass relation. This result suggests that BHs in high redshift quasars either got a major head-start or grew faster than their host galaxies; if the M- σ relation existed at z∼6, would show a strong cosmic evolution. Numerous subsequent works have focused on the correlation of SMBH mass and galaxy dynamical mass at these redshifts (e.g., Wang et al. 2016, Decarli et al. 2018). Most of these studies had to assume an inclination angle and/or an average size for the emitting gas. Neeleman et al. (2021) carried out careful dynamic modeling of their [C ii] observations (including inclination and size). They found a mean dynamical mass of ∼5 ×1010 M⊙ for a sample of luminous z ∼6 quasars with ∼109 M⊙BHs. As shown in Fig. 10, this places them about one order of magnitude above the local relation. It is important to note that the relationship could be strongly aﬀected by potential biases from selection and by using gas tracers (Huang et al. 2018, Volonteri & Stark 2011). Indeed, observations of low luminosity quasars show a narrower [C ii] line width (e.g., Willott et al. 2017, Izumi et al. 2018), placing them close to the local relation. Habouzit et al. (2022) analyzed the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies in six cosmological simulations with diﬀerent models for SMBH growth. Although the simulations are all consistent at z∼0, they diverge at z >5, highlighting the importance of obtaining robust observational constraints at these redshifts. Li et al. (2022a) argued that to robustly www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 27 conﬁrm whether the highest-redshift quasar population resides above the local BH - bulge mass relation, an improvement in the accuracy of mass measurements and an expansion of the current sample to lower black hole masses is required. We expect that JWST will enable signiﬁcant advances for BH and galaxy host masses. 5.4. Evidence of Quasar Feedback Central accreting SMBHs play an important role in shaping galaxy evolution (see review by Fabian 2012). Indeed, to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxy masses at z= 0, simulations require that strong AGN feedback was already in place at z ∼6 (e.g., Kaviraj et al. 2017). Below we list some',\n",

       "  'of the observational evidence (with caveats) that these feedback mechanisms are taking place in the z≳ 6 quasar population: UV Line Shifts. High-redshift quasars show asymmetric shape and velocity oﬀset of high ionization lines, in particular the C iv line. The low-redshift quasar population shows an overall blueshifted C iv line (∼800 km s −1) compared to the systemic redshift of the quasar (e.g., traced by H β, Shen et al. 2011). This shift is generally understood in the context of a strong accretion disk wind that contributes to the high-ionization lines (e.g., Richards et al. 2011). At z >6, the C iv line velocity shift is much stronger ( ∼1800 km s−1, Schindler et al. 2020). Meyer et al. (2019) suggested that this redshift evolution can be explained by the C iv winds being launched from the disk with an increased torus opacity at this redshift. BAL Quasars. A fraction of quasars show broad and highly blue-shifted absorption features in their rest-frame UV transitions. BAL features trace ionized winds in the broad line region and are recognized signatures of SMBH feedback. Bischetti et al. (2022) used high-quality spectra of quasars from the XQR30 survey to show that up to ∼ 50% of luminous quasars at z ∼6 exhibit BAL features (with outﬂow velocities up to 17% of the speed of light), compared to about 20% observed in low-redshift samples. Yang et al. (2021) studied 37 quasars at 6.3 <z <7.64 and reported a BAL fraction of ∼24%, smaller than the Bischetti et al. (2022) work but still slightly larger than what is observed at lower redshifts. This potential evolution of the BAL fraction could be a result of the strong feedback associated with the rapid BH growth and galaxy assembly in the early Universe. Lyα halos. The existence of extended Ly αnebulae around z≳ 6 quasars was discussed in Section 5.1. Recently, Costa et al. (2022) performed a suite of cosmological, radiation- hydrodynamic simulations to understand the origin and properties of the observed Ly α halos. The simulations unambiguously require quasar-powered outﬂows to match the ob- served properties at z≳ 6, providing indirect evidence for AGN feedback. Radio jets. Only six galaxies hosting radio-loud quasars at z≳ 6 have been studied with ALMA and NOEMA (Rojas-Ruiz et al. 2021, Khusanova et al. 2022).',\n",

However, Rojas-Ruiz et al. (2021) and Khusanova et al. (2022) show indirect evidence that the FIR emission of radio-loud quasars can be strongly aﬀected by synchrotron emission. In that case, their IR-derived star formation rates can be overestimated, implying that we might be witnessing negative AGN feedback at z >6. However, more measurements of the FIR continuum and/or an enlarged sample are required to quantify the potential impact on the population. 28 Fan et al. Broad components of [CII] emission.Broad wings (≳ 1000 km s−1) in the [Cii] emission lines are thought to be caused by AGN outﬂows. The observational evidence for these [C ii] broad wings remain tentative, as diﬀerent analyses of similar datasets provide inconsistent results. For example, Maiolino et al. (2012) and Cicone et al. (2015) reported a strong [C ii] outﬂow in the host galaxy of the quasar J1148+5251 at z = 6.42. Meyer et al. (2022b), on the other hand, found no evidence of a broad velocity component but reported that J1148+5251 has the most spatially extended [C ii] emission (∼10 kpc) among z∼6 quasar hosts. Izumi et al. (2021) report a broad ( ∼1000 km s−1) [C ii] wing in the spectrum of a quasar at z= 7.07, and Khusanova et al. (2022) reported a tentative [Cii] broad component that could be as wide as ∼1400 km s−1 in a BAL radio-loud quasar at z = 6.12. Bischetti et al. (2019) stacked the [C ii] spectra of 48 quasars at 4 .5 <z <7.1 and reported a broad [C ii] component, while Decarli et al. (2018) stacked the [C ii] spectra of 23 z ∼6 quasar hosts and found no evidence for a [C ii] broad component. Novak et al. (2020) stacked the [C ii] spectra using diﬀerent techniques (spectral stacking and uv-plane stacking) and found no evidence for [C ii] broad-line emission. Novak et al.

Protoclusters and Large Scale Structure Theoretical models predict that z≳ 6 quasars should be highly biased tracers of the under- lying dark matter distribution, signposting the ﬁrst overdensities of galaxies on Mpc scales, i.e., protoclusters (e.g., Overzier et al. 2009, Costa et al. 2014; but some scatter is expected, see e.g., Ren et al. 2021). Observationally, this has been challenging to demonstrate. Photo- metric selection around high-redshift quasars has found evidence for overdensities (e.g., Ut- sumi et al. 2010, Morselli et al. 2014), densities comparable to random ﬁelds (e.g., Ba˜ nados et al. 2013, Simpson et al. 2014, Mazzucchelli et al. 2017a), and even underdensities (e.g., Kim et al. 2009). There are currently two z ≳ 6 quasar ﬁelds with robust overdensities (i.e., including spectroscopic conﬁrmation) on Mpc scales (Overzier 2022, Mignoli et al. 2020; see Fig. 11). These are SDSS J1030+0524 at z = 6.3 and SDSS J0836+0054 at z = 5.8. The works by Stiavelli et al. (2005), Kim et al. (2009), Simpson et al. (2014), Balmaverde et al. (2017), Decarli et al. (2019b) were crucial for conﬁrming the overdense environment of J1030+0524. Similarly, Zheng et al. (2006), Ajiki et al. (2006), Bosman et al. (2020) were fundamental for conﬁrming the large-scale structure around J0836+0054. Recently, Yue et al. (2021a) report the ﬁrst quasar pair known at z∼6 (with a projected separation <10',\n",

ALMA observations of z ∼6 quasars hosts (see Section 5.2) have serendipitously de- tected a population of [C ii]-bright companion galaxies in the immediate environment of ∼20-50% of the targeted quasars (Decarli et al. 2017, Neeleman et al. 2019, Venemans et al. 2020; see also bottom panel of Fig. 9). The large fraction of such quasar-galaxy pairs exceeds by orders of magnitude the expectations based on the current constraints of the number density of [C ii]-bright galaxies at these redshifts. Three out of ﬁve quasar companions with deep HST observations remain undetected (Mazzucchelli et al. 2019, Decarli et al. 2019a), implying a signiﬁcant part of a potential large-scale structure might be obscured. The two HST-detected companions show tentative evidence of AGN activity (Connor et al. 2019, Vito et al. 2019b; but see also Vito et al. 2021). The ﬁeld of view of ALMA is too small to study whether these gas-rich companions exist in large numbers over Mpc scales as predicted by simulations. MUSE observations of one of these quasar/companion ﬁelds reveal two additional LAEs in close proximity, strengthening the case for an overdensity (Meyer et al. 2022a). It is likely that the next leap on our understanding of the environment of the highest-redshift quasars will come with JWST. JWST deep imaging, multi-object, and slitless spectroscopy capabilities will provide a new opportunity to probe the galaxy population in z≳ 6 quasar environments to unprecedented depth over the Mpc scales. 6. QUASARS AS PROBES OF COSMIC REIONIZATION Quasars are both agents, and powerful probes of the cosmic reionization history. As rare but luminous sources with hard ionizing spectra, they contribute to the overall photon budget driving reionization, together with stellar photons from galaxies. Absorption measured in quasar spectra from foreground gas has yielded many of the most sensitive constraints on the density, ionization, and chemical enrichment of this tenuous intergalactic material. While quasars’ utility as reionization probes has been understood since foundational work by Gunn & Peterson (1965), it has taken 40-50 years for quasar surveys to uncover objects deep into the reionization epoch and fully exploit the information that their absorption 30 Fan et al. spectra encode (Fan et al. 2006b). While absorption studies have yielded many of the most precise constraints',\n",

       " ['pdf2.pdf',\n",
       "  'on the IGM opacity and neutral hydrogen fraction, they are subject to limitations on both system- atic accuracy, and physical interpretation. These limitations arise from multiple sources, but the most signiﬁcant factors discussed below are (a) uncertainty in the quasar’s in- trinsic/unabsorbed spectral continuum, (b) the large on-resonance oscillator strength of H i Lyα, which leads to a wide gap in sensitivity between neutral fractions of XH i ∼10−4 (where resonance absorption saturates) and ∼10−1 (where damping wings appear), and (c) computational challenges of simulating representative volumes with inhomogeneous and rapidly evolving radiation ﬁelds. 6.1. AGN and the Ionizing Photon Budget Quasar accretion produces a hard ionizing spectrum, making the AGN population a con- tributing source to the budget of photons needed for reionization. However as detailed in the recent review by Robertson (2021) and references therein, there is an emerging con- sensus that AGN play a subdominant role compared to galaxies as an overall driver of the phase transition, even when one extrapolates observed luminosity functions to thresholds fainter than current detection limits. Jiang et al. (2022) further reinforced this conclusion by placing an upper limit on the contributions of low luminosity AGN to reionization us- ing deep HST survey data. Finkelstein & Bagley (2022) have synthesized measurements across the lierature of galaxy+AGN UV luminosity functions, to estimate their relative contributions to the ionizing photon budget, using strong assumptions about the ionizing radiation escape fractions of each population. They estimate that AGN supply ∼10% of the total ionizing photon budget at z∼5, roughly the lower limit of redshifts considered in our review. They found that this fraction drops rapidly toward higher redshift because of diﬀerential downward evolution in the quasar luminosity function relative to galaxies. By z∼7 they estimate that AGN contribute only 0 .3 −1.0% of all ionizing photons, declining by yet another order of magnitude by z∼9. In contrast, Giallongo et al. (2019) suggested that AGN contributions to the UV background can still be signiﬁcant at z ∼5.6 based on X-ray selected objects. The quantitative uncertainties in these analyses are still considerable; Finkelstein et al. (2019) found a 10 ×higher contribution from AGN at z ∼7 using diﬀerent assumptions. Much of this may be attributed to uncertainties in the faint end slope of the quasar lu- minosity function. Still, the qualitative',\n",
       "  574],\n",
       " ['pdf2.pdf',\n",
       "  'picture that reionization is heavily dominated by star-forming galaxies appears to remain fairly robust with respect to these uncertainties. The fractional contribution of quasars and AGN increases toward lower redshift because of their rapidly rising number densities, such that they are more likely to dominate the meta- galactic UV background in the at z <4 post-reionization universe. New surveys with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and JWST should revolutionize this ﬁeld, providing both deep, near-IR color selected objects deep into the EoR, and also sensitive spectra to conﬁrm the AGN nature of faint candidates and separate them from star-forming galaxies. www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 31 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 Flux ï 15 ï 10 ï 5 0 R (Physical Mpc) ï 10 ï 5 0 x HI Ionization Front Damping Wing z ≳ 7 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 Flux ï 15 ï 10 ï 5 0 R (Physical Mpc) ï 10 ï 5 0 x HI Proximity Zone z ∼ 6 Behind QSO Figure 12 Observable properties and interpretation of Proximity Zones (upper left) and Damping Wings (upper right).

The leading fraction has units of cross section per unit frequency in terms of the dimension- less oscillator strength f12, which is an atomic constant determined for each ion (f12 = 0.416 for Lyα). The expression in brackets reﬂects a column density, i.e. an integral of the radial line element, weighted by the H i density ﬁeld. The function φ(ν) is a unity-normalized line shape. It is typically approximated as a Voigt proﬁle, which consists of a deep Gaussian line core whose width is determined by internal velocities, convolved with a much wider but also much weaker Lorentzian wing. This so-called “damping wing” arises from an energy-time uncertainty in the Lyα transition, leading to a small but non-zero absorption cross section in the rest frame for photons far from the resonance wavelengthλrest = 1215.67 ˚A. Equation 12 indicates that the optical depth at each observed wavelength λobs contains contributions 32 Fan et al. from neutral hydrogen at every intervening foreground redshift. However because φ(ν) is so sharply peaked around line resonance, the integral is almost always dominated by matter at the redshift where λobs/(1 + z) = λrest. Directly at this resonance wavelength, the Lyαcross section is very large—roughly 4×10−14 cm2.

Collectively these lead to a very large Ly α optical depth of τ ∼105 if the IGM is 100% neutral. However, observations show τ = O(∼1) at 2 <z <4; the presence of transmitted ﬂux implies that the Ly α forest is only neutral at the XH i ∼10−5 level. The optical depth increases toward high redshift in tandem with the neutral fraction, but by the time the neutral fraction reaches XH i ∼10−4, the optical depth already exceeds τ >5, at which point > 99% of the background quasar’s light is absorbed. On-resonance line absorption is simply too strong to provide useful measurements of the neutral fraction XH i above this value.',\n",

The eponymous Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA) phenomenon is therefore only seen in small, rare high-overdensity environments with large column densities ( NHI >1020) at z <5. Reionization is characterized by an increasing neutral fraction in the diﬀuse IGM, which eventually becomes strong enough to produce damping wings (Miralda-Escud´ e 1998). How- ever these are convolved with on-resonance absorption from H i at other redshifts, with the unique exception of the quasar’s immediate foreground, where the damping wing can extend redward of the Lyα emission line. Bridging this gap between strong on-resonance absorption, whose measurements probe 10−6 < XH i < 10−4, and weak oﬀ-resonance damping wings which only emerge at XH i >10−1 is a recurring theme for IGM measurements near the reionization epoch. On- resonance measurements are most useful in regions of locally enhanced ionization or at lower redshifts (z <6.3) toward the late stages of reionization. Damping wing measurements are most powerful at early times and higher neutral fractions seen for z >7. Observational constraints are much less precise for the epochs in the range 6.3 <z <6.8, when the neutral fraction evolved from 0 .01% to 10%— the Ly α line absorption is saturated, but damping wings have not yet emerged. 6.2.1. Numerical Simulations. Cosmological simulations play an essential role in interpret- ing the spectra of reionization-epoch quasars, and placing their associated transmission measurements into a broader physical context. We refer the reader to an excellent recent review (Gnedin & Madau 2022) on theoretical and numerical reionization models for a comprehensive overview of key methods and simulation projects. Brieﬂy, simulations must confront several intersecting challenges in the attempt to repro- duce the quasar spectral observables summarized below, together with luminosity functions of reionization-era galaxy populations. An idealized simulation should have: • A large box ( L> 100 cMpc) to cover many scale lengths of the galaxy-galaxy auto- www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 33 correlation function, and to sample the rare high-density peaks that could plausibly host M >109M⊙SMBHs. • Suﬃcient spatial and mass resolution to model disk galaxies realistically',\n",

       " ['pdf2.pdf',\n",
       "  'and resolve low-mass halos that produce light and heavy elements, as well as small-scale features in the Lyαforest and Lyman Limit systems that act as ionizing radiation sinks. • Ray tracing of emergent radiation from individual galaxies, to account for spatial variations in the density and ionizing background, shadowing from optically thick absorbers, or the timing of reionization. • Full and self-consistent coupling of radiation to hydrodynamics, to capture the eﬀect of ionization heating, pressure smoothing and adiabatic cooling on the evolving den- sity ﬁeld and ionization fraction. These will also impact the formation of subsequent stars and galaxies. Computational limits prevent practical simulations from meeting all four these requirements simultaneously, though rapid progress in recent years has allowed some groups to progress from analytic or semi-numerical eﬀorts to meet two or even three of the above bullets in single simulations. The Gnedin & Madau review contains a helpful classiﬁcation of leading numerical projects according to their box sizes, hydro prescriptions, treatment of the UV background, and radiation-hydro coupling. While most large-scale simulations focus on reproducing global reionization signals such as the volume-averaged neutral fraction, a separate numerical toolkit has evolved speciﬁcally to interpret observations of proximity zones (Sec 6.3.1) and damping wings (Sec 6.3.2) produced in the immediate foreground of luminous quasars. These investigations begin with global simulations of the reionization-era IGM, and in- troduce the eﬀect of a high-luminosity quasar by hand in the simulation volume. A large parent simulation is searched for high-mass halos ( M ≥1 −2 ×1011M⊙) representative of hosts where SMBHs are ﬁrst thought to form. A bright quasar is then inserted at the center of the halo, emitting ionizing photons with a luminosity scaled to the absolute 1450 ˚A mag- nitude of known quasars, and extrapolated to the Lyman edge using carefully constructed template SEDs. The simulation is then evolved forward to follow expansion of the ion- ization front or proximity zone into the IGM. Multiple sightlines are drawn through the simulation box, terminating at the quasar’s host halo, and simulated transmission spectra are extracted using the density, temperature, ionization and velocity cubes. This methodology has been adapted by several groups to place joint constraints on quasar lifetimes and the IGM neutral fraction at z >7 (Bolton et al. 2011, Keating et al. 2015, Davies et al.',\n",

In ionized proximity zones, the simulations can also be used to calibrate methods to reconstruct the ﬂuctuating density ﬁeld near the central host (Chen et al. 2022). Essentially the simulations are used to generate statistical realizations of the matter distribution around massive quasar host halos, capturing non-linear physics and scale- dependent correlations in a way that analytic PDFs of the optical depth and/or excursion set formalism cannot accomplish. A completely separate class of simulations is beginning to address challenging questions about heavy element enrichment of the early IGM and CGM (Keating et al. 2016), for comparison with observation of heavy element absorption in z >6 QSO spectra. These simulations rely on subgrid feedback prescriptions for metal production, which are then 34 Fan et al. transported with standard hydro treatments as at lower redshift. Translation from metal abundances into observable column densities is more complicated than for HI, because the ionization balance of multi-level ions depends on the UV background at other, often harder energies than the Lyman edge. A notable early eﬀort in multi-frequency treatment of an inhomogeneous background is the Technicolor Dawn simulation (Finlator et al. 2018), which tracks 24 separate frequencies and measures ionization balances of C IV and Si IV in the z >5.5 universe, though with a much smaller box size ( L ∼12 cMpc) than the aforementioned simulations designed to capture quasar host halos. 3 4 5 60.1 1 10 100 O’Meara et al.

Early discoveries of z >6 SDSS quasars (Fan et al. 2001) led to a reexamination of underlying assumptions about smooth evolution in XH i approaching reionization. In particular, deep medium-resolution spectroscopy of one of very ﬁrst such objects — SDSS J1030+0524 at z = 6.3 — revealed a region of Lya forest absorption consistent with zero ﬂux at wavelengths corresponding to 5 .95 < z < 6.16 (Becker et al. 2001). This work has been interpreted as the ﬁrst detection of a robust Gunn- Peterson absorption trough, and has been followed by many similar analyses to improve how the IGM opacity is quantiﬁed (Fan et al. 2006b, Yang et al. 2020a, Bosman et al. 2018, Eilers et al. 2018, Becker et al. 2007, Pentericci et al. 2002). The simplest absorption indicator from a conceptual standpoint is the Ly α opacity, τ = −ln(I/I0), where I0 represents an estimate of the unabsorbed continuum ﬂux level. Deeper spectra of SDSS J1030+0524 and many subsequently discovered objects consistently uncover similar spans of total absorption in Ly α resonance line at z >6, implying a large www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 35 lower bound on τ limited only by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spectral data. This highlights an important challenge in such measurements: the physical information is contained in measuring ﬂux that is not seen. The logarithmic nature of optical depth means that even in spectra with SNR ∼100 one can measure limits of τ ≳ 4 (per pixel) at best, and the zero points can be aﬀected by systematic errors in data reduction, including accurate subtraction night sky emission and correction for telluric absorption. Comparison of observations of the same quasars observed with diﬀerent instruments and reduced with diﬀerent pipelines indicate discrepancies at the 1–2% ﬂux level, for a mean transmitted ﬂux of 0.5–1.0% at z∼6 (McGreer et al. 2011, Eilers et al. 2018).

These have progressively decreasing oscillator strengths and require correspondingly larger H icolumn to saturate, allowing access to larger values of τ. This advantage is oﬀset by complications arising from unknown blending with Ly α forest absorption at lower redshift, and uncertainty in extrapolating the intrinsic quasar continuum from Lyα to Lyβ. Measurements of the Lyαopacity are always smoothed to suppress noise and minimize the eﬀect of diﬀering spectral dispersion and resolution among instruments used in the observations. Following Fan et al. (2006b), most early studies have used observationally- motivated redshift bins of ∆z= 0.15 for ease of comparison, deﬁnining the ”eﬀective optical depth” τeﬀ = −ln ⟨F⟩over the smoothing interval. More recent studies advocate for a physically-motivated bin size of 50 cMpc, because a constant redshift interval evolves by ∼40% in comoving length over 5 <z <7 where such measurements are made (Eilers et al. 2018, Becker et al. 2015). The two values (∆ z = 0 .15 and 50 cMpc) are comparable at z∼7. Fig 13 (left panel) presents a recent summary of Ly α optical depth measurements. Average τ measurements are simply the ﬁrst moment of an underlying optical depth distribution, which contains richer information and has therefore been measured extensively and presented as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of optical depth. Evolution of the CDF is characterized by three phases, again reﬂecting the logarithmic nature of the measurements. At z ∼5.0 −5.3 the distribution is fairly narrow and centered around τ ∼2, corresponding to a Lyαforest with signiﬁcant (∼90%) absorption at line resonance, but not yet fully saturated. At 5 .5 < z <6.0 the CDF widens to span 2 < τ <6, as an increasing number of smoothed windows exhibit saturated absorption (i.e. zero transmitted ﬂux or high τ), but many signiﬁcant transmission/low neutral fraction windows remain. Above z >6 it becomes increasingly rare to ﬁnd unsaturated windows with τ <4, and the distribution once again narrows because spectral SNR renders theτ >6 regime inaccessible. Several groups have explored alternative ionization metrics that use counts of trans- mission spikes in the Lya forest, motivated by the many challenges of measuring optical depths in realistic, heavily absorbed data.

These can be counted in spectra of varying resolution and SNR using similar techniques as are used for blind searches for metal absorption lines in quasar spectra. Their analysis indicates that, after accounting for instrumental broadening and noise which suppress the spike count in realistic observed 5 <z <6 spectra by an order of magnitude, the observed spike counts are roughly consistent with their self-consistent simulations of the post-reionization IGM transmission. In the simulation boxes, transmission spikes arise from regions that are under-dense in hydrogen and galaxies, but over-ionized relative to expectations from equilibrium with the average radiation ﬁeld, likely because of proximity 36 Fan et al. to local ionizing sources. At z >6 one expects transmission spikes to be exceedingly rare, so the detection even of single spikes implies the existence of early ionized cavities. Searches for spikes in high- redshift spectra have yielded several detections at 6 < z <6.3 that provide upper bounds on the local optical depth, complementing the lower bounds derived from measurements of saturated spectral regions (e.g., Yang et al. 2020a). A very diﬀerent way to conceptualize reionization is as a rapid increase in the mean- free-path (mfp) of ionizing photons. Although this is physically equivalent to an increase in the volume-averaged ionization fraction, this alternative framing allows a diﬀerent anal- ysis approach that does not require high-SNR measurements of localized pixels or spikes. Instead, samples of quasar spectra are stacked after shifting into the rest frame. Then a low- dimensional parametric model is ﬁt to the shape of the stacked spectrum below the Lyman limit at 912 ˚A, corresponding to a probabilistic ﬂight length of ionizing photons traveling from the quasar toward Earth. This model was originally developed at lower redshift to study the evolution of the ionizing background far from the background quasar. At high redshift, additional complexity must be added to the model to account for local ionization eﬀects near the quasar, since the mean free path can approach the length scale of proximity zones of enhanced ionization around the quasar.

This evolution is much stronger than would be inferred from extrapolation of the evolving mfp at lower redshifts, as one would expect in the late stages of a phase transition like reionization. 6.2.3. Dark Gaps and the late stages of reionization. The inverse phenomenon of Ly α transmission spikes—which trace the ﬁrst environments to complete reionization at z >6— several quasar sightlines exhibit long, dark gaps of zero ﬂux at z <6. These gaps are now understood to represent residual islands of neutral matter during late-stage reionization. As ﬁrst explored by Becker et al. (2015) after the discovery of a > 110 cMpc dark span towards the quasar ULAS J0148+0600, measurements of gap length have the advantage of being relatively insensitive to the details of estimating the quasar continuum, or absolute ﬂux levels. Long gaps are not seen at z ∼5, and indeed recent work by Zhu et al. (2021) ﬁnds that 90% of quasar spectra at z ∼6 have a dark gap of 30 cMpc or longer, but only 15% do at z= 5.6. Gap statistics have generated signiﬁcant theoretical interest, as they appear to be incon- sistent with numerical models approximating the ionizing UV background ﬁeld as spatially uniform at z= 5.5−6 (Zhu et al. 2021). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the phenomenon, including (a) upward ﬂuctuations in gas density (yielding a higher recom- bination rate and neutral fraction), (b) downward ﬂuctuations in the ionizing radiation background, or (c) upward ﬂuctuations in galaxy number density, leading to lower-than- average temperatures (D’Aloisio et al. 2015). The latter scenario is less intuitive, arising from a subtle eﬀect where regions of high galaxy density reionize early, and then have more time to cool oﬀ from the associated photoionization heating. These ﬁrst areas to reionize have a lower temperature than surrounding regions that reionize later and have not yet cooled. Because the H i recombination rate scales as T−0.7, cooler regions that reionized www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 37 earliest would have higher neutral fraction and opacity characteristic of dark gaps.

       "  'dark gap models arising from UV background versus temperature-driven ﬂuctuations (Davies et al. 2018a). Galaxy surveys along sightlines with gaps should see an enhancement in galaxy counts relative to the ﬁeld if the gaps arise in cool regions that reionized early; conversely there should be a galaxy deﬁcit if the gaps arise in islands of enhanced neutral fraction and/or low ionizing radiation background (two eﬀects which are not straightforward to distinguish). Christenson et al. (2021), Becker et al. (2018), and Ishimoto et al. (2022) conducted narrowband Lya surveys in ﬁelds centered on well-known dark gaps to test this prediction, and found an underdensity of Lyman-alpha emitters within 20h−1 Mpc of the quasar sightline, favoring a scenario where the dark gaps represent residual neutral islands persisting in the late-reionization universe. Spectroscopic galaxy surveys have been diﬃcult and expensive at these redshifts from the ground, but early observations with JWST indicate that prospects are very favorable for correlating galaxies observed in rest-frame optical emission lines with the IGM Lya opacity. Overall, a consistent picture emerges from a suite of distinct IGM observations using quasar spectra, including (a) the average Lyαoptical depth and its CDF, (b) dark gaps, (c) transmission spikes, and (d) the mean free path. The ﬁrst three of these four measurements result from on-resonance Ly α absorption and the fourth measures the Lyman continuum, making them all most useful toward the tail end of reionization at 5 .5 <z <6.3, when the volume-averaged neutral fraction is ∼10−4, but with signiﬁcant spatial ﬂuctuations. Taken together there is evidence that large neutral islands persisted well after z ∼6, possibly in regions of low galaxy density and ambient ionizing radiation. During this time there was a tenfold increase in the mean free path for ionizing photons, eventually reaching cosmological length scales of 10 pMpc or more. The earliest regions to fully reionize can be traced by transmission spikes at z ∼6.3, and are likely to reside in regions of low gas density that happen by chance to fall near a source of ionizing radiation. 6.2.4. Thermal signatures. Ionizing sources emit a spectrum of radiation including photons with energy above the E > 13.6 eV Hydrogen ionization potential. The excess photon energy heats the post-reionization IGM, which subsequently cools over time due to adiabatic cosmic expansion. Such heating',\n",

       "  'and cooling is clearly seen during the reionization of He ii at lower redshift (Walther et al. 2019); an even larger eﬀect should be present for Hydrogen reionization. Unfortunately unlike He ii, it is not possible to measure heating from Hydrogen reionization in “real time”, because Gunn-Peterson absorption fully blankets the signal at the redshifts of interest. Nevertheless the temperature of the IGM at lower redshift—after reionization is complete—still encodes information about the past thermal history. High-resolution quasar spectra are excellent thermometers of the IGM, because thermal gas motions projected along the line of sight smooth or broaden absorption features. At lower redshifts where individual unblended lines can be resolved in the Lyαforest, tempera- ture maps directly to line proﬁle width through the Voigt proﬁle parameterb= √ 2kT/mion, though this signature is convolved with similar broadening from turbulence and bulk gas motions. At z >4.5 it becomes impossible to distinguish individual lines, so the IGM’s temper- ature signal must be measured statistically. Eﬀectively, thermal eﬀects impose a low-pass ﬁlter on the power spectrum, smoothing out small scale structure in the pattern of Ly α transmission. The band limit of this ﬁlter is a partly a proxy for the instantaneous tem- perature, but it also retains a memory of past heating, which is partly manifested through 38 Fan et al. a pressure (i.e. Jeans) broadening beyond the normal Hubble ﬂow. These eﬀects are cali- brated by statistical comparison to cosmological simulations. The simulations are generally run on a grid which varies the mean temperature of the IGM at speciﬁed redshifts T0(z), the slope γ of the IGM’s temperature-density relation T(∆) = T0∆γ−1, and the thermal energy injected into the IGM during reionization u0, in units of eV per baryon. Synthetic spectra are drawn directly from simulation volumes and run through identical analysis software as the true quasar spectra, to ascertain which combination of T0,γ and u0 produce 1D ﬂux power spectra most closely matching observed values. Using these methods, Boera et al. (2019) ﬁnd IGM temperatures of T0 = 7000 −8000 K at 4 .2 <z <5.0, which is where the eﬀective optical depth of the forest is 1 <τeﬀ <2, making the method most sensitive. Toward higher redshifts where Gunn-Peterson satura- tion begins to manifest, thermal measurements become increasingly challenging. However recent constraints have',\n",

The simulations can also explore a range of diﬀerent reionization histories to see which parameters best reproduce the post-reionization power spectrum. Toy models of instan- taneous reionization provide joint constraints on the redshift of thermal injection and its amplitude, favoring z ∼8 −10 as the reionization redshift, and peak post-reionization temperatures of T = 10,000 −20,000 K depending on the choice of ionizing background spectrum. Temperature constraints on the reionization history are limited because the IGM tends to rapidly cool back to its ionization equilibrium temperature, washing out the signal from the initial thermal impulse. As mentioned above, the rapid thermal broaden- ing is accompanied by a pressure broadening that also manifests in the power spectrum, and is somewhat longer lived. It is not possible to fully disentangle pressure and tem- perature smoothing eﬀects from line-of-sight measurements. However measurements made using pairs of adjacent quasar sightlines can break this degeneracy, since they only measure smoothing on a transverse spatial scale by construction (Rorai et al. 2017). Summarizing, while the power spectrum and thermal history cannot provide precision constraints on the timing of hydrogen reionization, it supports a general result that by z∼5, the initial thermal energy injected into the IGM has already cooled substantially, by perhaps a factor of 2 −3. This sets a lower bound on the elapsed time between the period of thermal energy injection and z∼4 −5 where the measurements are made. This in turn implies that the peak heating associated with reionization occurred at 7 <z <10, broadly consistent with CMB results reported by Planck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020). 6.3. Neutral Hydrogen Absorption in the Quasar Environment Each quasar spectrum oﬀers the opportunity to study radiative feedback in the neighbor- hood of a luminous source of ionizing photons: the background object itself. At 2 <z <3, a clear deﬁcit is seen in the density of Lyman alpha forest lines as a quasar’s emission redshift is approached (Murdoch et al. 1986, Bajtlik et al. 1988).

This measurement becomes increasingly valuable at high redshift, because the diﬀuse www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 39 Figure 14 The size distribution of proximity zones at 5 .9 <z <6.4 (Eilers et al. 2021), versus their host quasar’s absolute magnitude or luminosity. Shaded region shows expectations from a numerical simulation assuming the quasar has reached ionization equilibrium with its surroundings. This matches a representative sample of quasars at these redshifts (gray points), but separate samples have been identiﬁed with small proximity zones that have been interpreted as evidence of recent UV accretion episodes. IGM is optically thick to Lyαabsorption. However the observational manifestation of inter- actions between quasar radiation and the IGM diﬀers according to whether the surrounding medium has already undergone reionization — in which case one observes a “proximity zone” — or the surrounding medium still has a high neutral fraction — in which case one observes a damping wing. Both phenomena are now well established; in the sections below we aim to clarify the distinction between the two, reconcile some diﬀerences in deﬁnitions, and clarify at which redshifts each one is most powerful. 6.3.1. Proximity zones and the eﬀects of quasar radiation on recently reionized matter. At zem ∼5.9−6.5, on-resonance (Gunn-Peterson) Lyαhas suﬃcient column density to fully absorb a quasar’s continuum. However the volume-averaged neutral fraction is only ∼10−4 during late-stage reionization, so a quasar’s local ionization boost can suppress the local Lyα opacity to optically thin values τ <1, allowing some ﬂux to transmit at wavelengths just blueward of the Ly α emission line. In exact analogy to the classic proximity eﬀect at lower redshift, these “proximity zones” at z ∼6 trace a local ionization enhancement in an already ionized medium. They should not be confused with Str¨ omgren spheres, because the outside medium has a neutral fraction XH i ≪1. The size of a quasar’s proximity zone depends on its ionizing photon luminosity, its lifetime (i.e. how long it has been shining in a UV-bright phase), and the density and 40 Fan et al. ionization of the surrounding medium. By convention, observers have deﬁned the proximity zone as',\n",

While observationally convenient and consistent, this deﬁnition is not motivated by any physical transition or process. It is loosely related to a radius of enhanced ionizing background, but at a 10% ﬂux threshold the enhancement is still very strong — the quasar contribution exceeds the ambient ﬁeld by an order of magnitude (Eilers et al. 2017). In select cases one may compare Ly α and Lyβ measurements to improve dynamic range in analogous fashion to IGM measurements (Mesinger & Haiman 2004). In this case, one is probing the sharpness of the boundary of enhanced ionization fraction. Uniformly selected samples have yielded typical proximity zone sizes of 2–6 pMpc, with a strong (expected) dependence on quasar luminosity, and comparatively weak dependence on redshift between 6 .0 < z <6.5 (Eilers et al. 2017, 2020). Intriguingly, after adjusting proximity zone sizes to normalize out the eﬀect of quasar luminosity, Eilers et al. (2017) found that ∼10% of their sample had exceptionally small proximity zones. They argued that the most likely explanation is that we are observing these quasars before their radiation ﬁeld has reached ionization equilibrium with the surrounding IGM, i.e. their current UV- luminous period is t <100,000 years old, with extreme objects even at t <10,000 years (Eilers et al. 2021). Stacking analysis of multiple quasars’ near zones indicates that the median quasar lifetime is larger by approximately an order of magnitude (Morey et al. 2021). Fig 14 presents a summary of proximity zone size measurements, along with “young quasars” identiﬁed through this type of measurement. If this interpretation is correct, then proximity zone size distributions can be used to constrain the UV duty cycle of early quasars. The size is sensitive only to the age of the most recent or current UV-bright episode, which is not necessarily the ﬁrst in its history. However the growth timescale problem for building SMBHs at z >6 is well known (see Sec 4; and Volonteri 2010), and this challenge is only exacerbated for any accretion duty cycle below unity.

As one penetrates deeper into the reionization epoch near z∼7, the ambient neutral fraction increases and the corresponding length scale of proximity zones becomes smaller. When the neutral fraction approaches 1–10%, the eﬀects of oﬀ- resonance Lyα damping wings become signiﬁcant (Miralda-Escud´ e 1998). Details of this process have been reviewed in Mortlock (2016). Brieﬂy, high column densities of neutral hydrogen in the nearby foreground of a quasar lead to a non-negligible probability that a photon emitted redward of Ly α in the quasar’s rest frame will still be absorbed by neutral intergalactic matter en route to Earth. This last fact is critical—in the far-foreground Ly α forest region there is an unresolvable degeneracy at any wavelength between oﬀ-resonance damping wing absorption from neutral gas, and on-resonance absorption from ionized gas at a diﬀerent redshift. In contrast, absorption redward of the Ly α emission line can only come from oﬀ-resonance interactions. The IGM damping signature is expected around quasars meeting two conditions: they have recently turned on, and are embedded in an IGM with high global neutral fraction. In contrast to z ∼6 proximity zones that have already been pre-ionized by surrounding galaxies, the z ∼7 quasars with damping wings are driving true ionization fronts into the www.annualreviews.org • Quasars and IGM at Cosmic Dawn 41 Figure 15 Damping wing measurements for J0252-0503 ( z= 7.00).

The strength of a damping wing is most sensitive to the neutral fraction of matter just outside the quasar’s ionization front. Gas closer to the quasar is inside the ionization front, so its neutral fraction is too low to produce oﬀ-resonance Ly α absorption wings. Gas that is far outside the ionization front can produce oﬀ-resonance absorption, but its line-of-sight velocity oﬀset is too large for the oﬀ-resonance wing to produce appreciable optical depth redward of Lya emission.

Diﬀerent groups have tackled this challenge using training sets of low-redshift SDSS or HST/COS spectra where the Ly α emission proﬁle and unabsorbed continuum can be estimated more reliably. The objective is to predict the unabsorbed Ly αemission line shape and forest continuum (and associated uncertainties) using pixels to the red of the quasar’s Ly α emission line. Multiple groups have used Principal Component Analysis (Davies et al. 2018c, Mort- lock et al. 2011), Machine/Deep Learning models (Liu & Bordoloi 2021), Neural Networks (ˇDurovˇ c´ ıkov´ a et al. 2020), covariance matrices (Greig et al. 2017, 2022), stacking of nearest- neighbor observed spectra (Simcoe et al. 2012, Bosman & Becker 2015, Bosman et al. 2021), or other hybrid approaches to train and validate continuum+Lyαsoftware on lower redshift quasars. Most methods also calculate some envelope of formal uncertainty on the contin- uum estimate before applying them to z ∼7 quasar spectra. When comparing diﬀerent reconstruction techniques in the Ly α/Lyβ forest region and around the Ly α emission line, the diﬀerence between continuum models for the same object using diﬀerent codes often exceeds expectations from their formal error estimates, indicating the presence of residual systematics. It has therefore been important to test observations of the same objects taken 42 Fan et al. using diﬀerent instruments and analysis software to build conﬁdence in the fundamental conclusion about damping wing strengths and the neutral fraction. Fig 15 illustrates some of the diﬀerent techniques in predicting the quasar intrinsic spectrum in the damping wing region of a quasar at z= 7.0. While it is impossible to know if any particular continuum realization is “correct”, a con- sensus is indeed emerging that certain speciﬁc objects — most notably ULASJ1342+0928 (z= 7.54; Ba˜ nados et al. 2018), DESJ0252−0503 (z= 7.00; Wang et al. 2020), J1007+2115 (z = 7.51; Yang et al. 2020b) and ULASJ1120+0641 ( z = 7.09; Mortlock et al. 2011) — show strong evidence for IGM damping wings for all continuum models explored in the literature. Various analyses derive slightly diﬀerent IGM neutral fractions for the same objects on account of modeling diﬀerences (Greig et al. 2022, 2019, Davies et al. 2018b, Bolton et al. 2011).

This combination of small proximity zone and damping wing has not been measured in a single quasar at z <7, despite the much larger sample sizes available for testing. Because most of the damping wing is generated just outside the ionized bubble, there is a risk that the same signature could arise from chance alignment of a classical damped Lyαabsorber (i.e. from the ISM of a bound proto-galaxy) near the quasar in an otherwise ionized IGM (Section 6.5). Indeed there are examples of such “proximate DLAs” in the literature, including several at z >6. The a priori odds of such a chance alignment are small, but were considered carefully in studies of the ﬁrst damping wing (Simcoe et al. 2012). There are two arguments now suggesting that this phenomenon is not aﬀecting IGM measurements at z >7. First, none of the four sightlines listed above exhibit heavy-element absorption at the redshift of the putative DLA, to very sensitive limits. Second, the presence of damping wings in multiple new z >7 discoveries points to a global phenomenon, as the joint probability of seeing proximate DLAs in all of these becomes lower still. With very high-SNR data it is in principle possible to distinguish between DLA absorption from the condensed CGM/ISM of a proto-galaxy and an extended patch of neutral but gravitationally unbound IGM using the damping proﬁle alone. However no studies at present have claimed such a detection. A ﬁnal unknowable factor in damping wing analysis is the spatial distribution of gas density and accompanying ﬂuctuations in ionization inside and outside the proximity zone. Early papers used analytic models based on distribution functions of overdensity, and as- sumed that the gas was in ionization equilibrium with a uniform background radiation ﬁeld (Mortlock et al. 2011, Simcoe et al. 2012). Later and more sophisticated treatments have drawn distributions of sightlines from cosmological simulations to capture the line-of-sight variations in density and ionization (Greig et al. 2019). Large simulation boxes are required for this method, to identify the rare, high-mass halos where early quasars are thought to reside. Many sightlines are constructed',\n",

They are nevertheless subject to substantial, and probably unresolvable systematic uncertainties concerning quasar continuum shape and details of the density and ionization ﬁelds around each quasar.

Adding more objects will potentially increase conﬁdence in the result, but may not reduce its fractional uncertainty to better than ±40%, since the uncertainty envelope is dominated by model assumptions and is therefore not random. Still this result is extremely signiﬁcant because any measurement placingXH i ∼50% (or at a similar order of magnitude) represents a working deﬁnition of the reionization midpoint. Fig 16 summarizes the various reionization constraints from diﬀerent quasar absorption observations, compared with both constraints from the measuremnts of CMB polarization (Robertson et al. 2015) and a number of empirical reionization history models.

This combination of limits and measurements permits models with a range of reionization histories with midpoints centered anywhere from 6.5 < z <8.0. Future 21-cm experiments will potentially measure these values with more precision and accuracy; these quasar constraints will help such experiments optimize their redshift window. Still, when expressed in terms of lookback time rather than redshift, quasar absorption constraints correspond to a 1–2% measurement of the timing of reionization, to 94.5+0.9 −0.5% lookback, or 760 +80 −120 Myr after the Big Bang. 6.4. Heavy Element Enrichment of Intervening Quasar Absorbers The radiative feedback that drove reionization was accompanied by chemical feedback that can also be observed in the spectra of high redshift quasars. At z >6, large samples of high-resolution quasar spectra taken with VLT/XShooter, Magellan/FIRE, Keck/NIRES and Gemini/GNIRS have revealed foreground heavy element absorption lines redward of 44 Fan et al. Lyα where the quasar’s continuum can be easily modeled. Because H i is saturated in the Lyα forest at z >6, metal absorption lines provide the only accessible information about diﬀuse gas at these epochs. Absorption strength in these papers is sometimes reported as column density Nion and other times as a rest-frame equivalent width Wr. The IR spectrographs listed above have intrinsic resolutions of ∆ v ∼50 km/s or coarser, which is insuﬃcient to resolve the ﬁne 5 −10 km/s velocity structure seen in metal-line absorbers at lower redshift. Equivalent width measurements are therefore conservative and will be consistently measured across all spectrographs. Column densities are easier to interpret physically, but must be approached with care, accounting for the possibility of unresolved saturation in the line core, or blend- ing of unresolved components. The detection sensitivity of current spectrographs limits metal line analyses to column densities characteristic of circumgalactic gas at lower red- shift. Deeper spectra or statistical stacks will be needed to search for metals in the diﬀuse IGM. Early studies of heavy element enrichment in the reionization epoch (Simcoe et al. 2011, D’Odorico et al. 2013, Ryan-Weber et al. 2006, Becker et al. 2009, Simcoe 2006) focused on the C iv doublet, which is',\n",

       " ['pdf2.pdf',\n",
       "  'the most ubiquitous IGM metal line at lower redshifts and a tracer of highly-ionized circumgalactic gas. At z >5.5 C iv shifts into the J band. Most surveys focus on a similar set of observables, including the comoving absorption density dN/dX1, and the equivalent width distribution d2N/dXdW. These surveys established that the frequency of C iv absorbers decreases toward higher redshift, such that individual C iv systems become rare at z >6 — most sightlines have no C iv doublets in this range. For example, Codoreanu et al. (2018) surveyed deep spec- tra of four quasar sightlines, ﬁnding a four-fold decrease in comoving line density dN/dX between z = 4 .8 and z = 5 .7, and zero detections above z >6, consistent with earlier but smaller studies in the literature (Simcoe et al. 2011). There is very tentative evidence of a steepening in the column density distribution function (CDDF) f(N) = d2N/dNdX, because of diﬀerential evolution of the strongest C iv absorbers at high redshift. However these analyses still utilize modest numbers of sightlines (<10), so shot noise and saturation become signiﬁcant limitations at the high- Wr end. There are now relatively large samples of high quality spectra for z >6.5 quasars, which should lead to improved estimates of the CDDF and C iv evolution in the near future. Evolving enrichment levels are sometimes summarized in terms of the C iv contribu- tion to closure density Ω CIV, which is a mass-weighted integral of the CDDF. Like dN/dX or the normalization of f(N), Ω CIV declines toward higher redshift. While it is conve- nient to express global metal enrichment in terms of this single number, the power-law slope f(N) ∝N−1.5 of the CDDF is shallower than α = −2, implying that the integral∫ Nf(N)dN diverges toward high column densities. The single strongest absorber in any sample therefore dominates the integral, meaning that by construction Ω CIV is aﬀected by shot noise and pathlength searched. The disappearance of C iv at high redshift could be driven either by a decline in heavy element abundances, or by a change in ionization. If abundance evolution predominates one 1The quantitydX = dz √ ΩM(1 + z)3 + ΩΛ is equivalent to a redshift path atz= 0, but accounts for pure cosmological evolution in the comoving radial line',\n",

However there have been robust detections of all these low-ionization lines at z >6, suggesting an important change in the ionization state of metal absorption line systems coincident with the reionization of intergalactic hydrogen. The ﬁrst detections of low-ionization metal absorption at z > 6 focused on the OI 1302, CII 1334, and SiII 1260 lines, which have rest wavelengths only slightly to the red of Lyαand can therefore be detected in high-resolution optical (rather than infrared) spectra (Becker et al. 2011). However the small oﬀset between these and Ly α also leaves a very short search pathlength per sightline; if they are too far in the quasar’s foreground these lines fall within the H i Gunn-Peterson trough and become impossible to detect. With improved IR spectra it became possible to search systematically for low-ionization Mg ii doublets at z >6, albeit with complex selection windows caused by broadband at- mospheric absorption between the J/H and H/K bands, discrete telluric absorption, and bright hydroxyl emission lines. After accounting for these eﬀects, Mg ii surveys ﬁnd trends consistent with the other neutral ions—there is no clear evolution in the comoving line den- sity dN/dX for systems with Wr >0.3˚A (although if one restricts to very strong absorbers, there is a slight excess at z∼3; Chen et al. 2017, Matejek & Simcoe 2012). Mg ii absorbers are now detected out to the highest known redshift of an absorption system, at z = 6.84 (Simcoe et al. 2020).

       "  'requires that as reionization is approached, one should eventually ﬁnd individual absorbers with CII, OI, SiII, and Mg ii but no detection of a highly ionized C iv 46 Fan et al. phase. This is indeed the case; in fact such low-ionization-only systems predominate at z >6, composing over 2/3 of all metal line absorbers (Cooper et al. 2019). In sharp contrast, “low-ionization only” absorbers are exceedingly rare at all redshifts z <5.5, indicating a qualitative change in the CGM’s observable properties during the reionization epoch. At 2 < z <4 OI, CII, and SiII are much more rare than C iv; nearly every known low-ionization absorber is accompanied by stronger Civ and SiIV lines oﬀset by <100 km/s, and there are many examples of Civ with no low-ionization lines (Cooper et al. 2019). Because absorption surveys are cross-section selected, the canonical interpretation is that ionized C iv traces a widespread low-density CGM, while OI, CII, and SiII trace cooled and condensed clumps in the ISM of a nearby galaxy, or small, cold precipitates embedded in the warm ionized CGM (Stern et al. 2016). The evolution of the number density of heavy element absorption systems is summarized in Fig 17. The observational disappearance of the ionized CGM implies that during this epoch where galaxies are in early assembly, their circumgalactic gas has not yet been enriched to observable levels, and/or the ambient radiation ﬁeld is insuﬃcient in intensity or hardness to maintain a high degree of ionization. Unfortunately it is impossible to calculate abundances directly at z > 6, because H i column density measurement is prevented by the Gunn- Peterson trough. However the number density of these low-ionization metal lines is similar to extrapolations of dN/dX for DLAs and sub-DLAs (Cooper et al. 2019, Becker et al. 2019) and is either ﬂat or slightly increasing at earlier times. If one assumes H i column densities in this range ( NHI >1019.8), the detected low-ionization lines are consistent with a metallicity of [C/H] ∼−2.3, in a warm neutral medium. If there exists a warm ionized medium of similar metallicity in pressure equilibrium with the warm neutral phase, it would be clearly detected in Civ. To evade detection, the ionized medium must have∼100×lower abundance, or [C/H]<−4 (Simcoe et al. 2020). If the heavy elements seen',\n",

       "  'in low ionization lines are produced locally to that environment, this implies that those metals have not yet been mixed into the ionized CGM. Evidently the galactic environments traced by z >6 metal absorbers bear some resemblance to metal-poor DLAs at lower redshifts, but they are at an early and immature stage of chemical evolution and mixing. 6.5. Metal Absorption in the Vicinity of QSO Hosts At all redshifts one can ﬁnd a rare but important class of metal absorbers in the immediate foreground of their respective quasar hosts (Prochaska et al. 2008). These “proximate DLAs” have a special importance, and four have been discovered at z >6. They are the only discrete absorbers in the reionization epoch for which it is possible to constrain NHI directly using the oﬀ-resonance wing. Because DLAs with NHI > 1020.3 cm−3 are self- shielded and largely neutral, the pDLAs therefore also permit direct measurement of heavy element abundances, with no ionization correction needed. The pDLAs are distinguished from IGM damping wings on the basis of coincident metal absorption. They are also found at lower redshift than the four z >7 IGM damping wing candidates—two pDLAs are at z∼6.3−6.4 (Ba˜ nados et al. 2019b, Andika et al. 2022), one at z ∼6 (Davies 2020), and one is at z = 5.93, 40 kpc from a galaxy detected with ALMA at coincident redshift (D’Odorico et al. 2018). At these redshifts no other quasars have exhibited metal-free damping wings, and many observations of transmission spikes indicate that reionization is well underway (Yang et al. 2020a). The pDLAs studied by Ba˜ nados et al. (2019b) and D’Odorico et al.

Neither shows evidence for anomalies in relative abundances, as might be expected from a medium enriched with Population III supernova debris. High ionization C iv and SiIV are not reported in either system, consistent with the discussion in the previous section about the disappearance of the high-ionization CGM phase. This has been cited as evidence that the pDLA originates outside of the quasar host, where the UV radiation ﬁeld should be enhanced and an ionized medium would be expected.',\n",

Summary Since the ﬁrst discoveries of reionization-era quasars more than twenty years ago, tremen- dous progress has been made in extending the frontiers of quasar research deeper into the cosmic dawn, in characterizing and understanding these objects in the context of early SMBH growth and galaxy formation, and in using them as beacons to shed light on the evolution of the IGM and the history of cosmic reionization. SUMMARY POINTS 1. The current frontier of quasar research is at z∼7.6, with a large statistical sample assembled at redshifts up to 7. High-redshift quasar selection is a challenging data mining problem because of the rarity of the targets, the limited training sets, and the overwhelmingly large number of contaminant sources, both astrophysical and instrumental. We provide a database of the properties of all published quasars at z >5.3 as Supplementary Materialthat accompanies this review. 2. The rapid evolution of the quasar LF has been well established. However, the exact shape of the LF is still uncertain, both at the high luminosity end due to small number statistics, and at the low luminosity end due to limitations of deep surveys. In sharp contrast, early quasars “look” almost identical to their low- redshift counterparts in spectral properties. Even the earliest known quasars have a well-established AGN structure. 3. There are more than 100 z≳ 6 quasars with robust BH mass measurements. Their masses range from ∼4 ×107 M⊙ to ∼1010 M⊙. The BHs are growing at high Ed- dington ratios ( λEﬀ,median = 0.79 and λEﬀ,mean = 0.92), with mild evidence of an increase of the accretion rate for z ≳ 6.5 quasars in comparison to luminosity- matched quasar samples at lower redshifts. 4. The UV stellar light in z ∼6 quasar hosts remains undetected, while on the other hand, (sub)mm observations have revealed the existence of copious amounts of gas and cold dust in many of these galaxies. Quasar hosts are massive, star-forming galaxies showing diverse morphology and kinematics; their average dynamical mass appears lower than that based on the local scaling relation between BH and galaxy masses. 5. Ly α absorption in quasars’ foreground IGM provides many of the most stringent constraints on',\n",

       " ['pdf2.pdf',\n",
       "  'the history of reionization, though the details of the observations vary with redshift. Toward the end of reionization at z <6, counts of transmission 48 Fan et al. spikes, dark gaps, and pixel optical depths indicate that universe is mostly ionized, but may harbor substantial islands of neutral matter as late as z ∼5.3. At z >7, four quasars have been discovered with prominent, metal-free damping wings that are thought to represent oﬀ-resonance absorption from an IGM with neutral fraction >10%, and possibly as high as 80%. 6. Heavy element absorption is seen in quasar spectra well into the epoch of reioniza- tion, tracing chemical feedback from stars whose radiation is also transforming the global ionization balance. It appears that these absorbers are high-redshift, low- metallicity analogs of damped Ly α absorbers observed at lower redshift. However the highly ionized phase of the circumgalactic medium, seen universally in CIV at z <6, abruptly vanishes in the EoR. This either indicates that the metals in the CGM are undergoing their own ionization transition, or that the ionized phase of the CGM has not yet been enriched with heavy elements at z >6. FUTURE ISSUES 1. With the new facilities planned for the next decade, we expect the quasar redshift frontier to reach redshift 9–10, when the ﬁrst generation of luminous quasars is forming. A key challenge will be the spectroscopic conﬁrmation of these faint high- redshift sources. 2. SMBH mass measurements using the H β line with JWST and gas-dynamical esti- mates with ALMA (and eventually the ngVLA) will provide more accurate measure- ments than what is currently possible. These results will be crucial to test whether the current methods calibrated at low redshift (e.g., Mg ii single-epoch virial mass) still hold at the highest accessible redshifts. To measure the BH masses of the pro- genitors of the currently observed z = 6 −7 quasar population, NIR spectroscopic follow-up with the ELTs will be key. 3. JWST will likely be able to ﬁnally reveal stellar light from z ≳ 6 quasar hosts. ALMA will continue playing a critical role in understanding and characterizing the interstellar medium of quasar host galaxies via multi-line diagnostics. 4. New quasar samples uncovered by Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope and observed with JWST and ELTs should substantially improve conﬁdence',\n",

JWST already shows promise of being transformative for surveys of galaxies in ﬁelds where high-redshift quasars have been used to constrain the IGM density ﬁeld. This may open the possibility of studying cross-correlations between Ly α, metals, and galaxies.

While the near-infrared (NIR) variability of Sgr A* was shown to be consistent over two decades, unprecedented activity in 2019 challenges existing statistical models. We investigate the origin of this activity by re-calibrating and re-analyzing all of our Keck Observatory Sgr A* imaging observations from 2005-2022. We present light curves from 69 observation epochs using the NIRC2 imager at 2.12 µm with laser guide star adaptive optics. These observations reveal that the mean luminosity of Sgr A* increased by a factor of ∼3 in 2019, and the 2019 light curves had higher variance than in all time periods we examined. We find that the 2020-2022 flux distribution is statistically consistent with the historical sample and model predictions, but with fewer bright measurements above 0.6 mJy at the ∼2σ level. Since 2019, we have observed a maximum Ks (2.2 µm) flux of 0.9 mJy, compared to the highest pre-2019 flux of 2.0 mJy and highest 2019 flux of 5.6 mJy. Our results suggest that the 2019 activity was caused by a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr A*, possibly due to delayed accretion of tidally-stripped gas from the gaseous object G2 in 2014. We also examine faint Sgr A* fluxes over a long time baseline to search for a quasi-steady quiescent state. We find that Sgr A* displays flux variations over a factor of ∼500, with no evidence for a quiescent state in the NIR.

       "  'The Milky Way’s Galactic center harbors the nearest supermassive black hole, providing a natural laboratory for detailed study of physical processes in its vicinity (e.g. Sch¨ odel et al. 2003; Ghez et al. 2008). Observations at radio, infrared, and X-ray wavelengths have revealed the Galactic black hole, Sgr A*, to be a continuously variable source (e.g. Falcke 1999; Baganoff et al. 2001; Genzel et al. 2003). The detailed nature of the vari- able emission can provide important constraints on how gas is captured from the black hole’s surrounding envi- ronment, as well as on the physical phenomena taking place within the accretion flow as the matter approaches Corresponding author: Grant C. Weldon gweldon@astro.ucla.edu the event horizon (e.g., reconnection events, hydrody- namic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, shocks, and lensing caustics). While accretion processes have been extensively studied in highly luminous active galac- tic nuclei, Sgr A* is an example of the ubiquitous pop- ulation of low-luminosity galactic nuclei in the nearby universe. By studying Sgr A*, we can learn more about accretion processes in these systems (for recent reviews see Genzel et al. 2010; Morris et al. 2012). Near-infrared (NIR) observations are particularly ef- fective for monitoring the variability of Sgr A*. While the radio band traces small variations in the bulk ac- cretion flow and the X-ray band is only sensitive to strong flares that rise above the extended local back- ground at the Galactic center, the resolved NIR source shows both large and small variations that can almost always be detected using adaptive optics on the largest arXiv:2308.09749v1 [astro-ph.GA] 18 Aug 2023 2 ground-based telescopes (e.g. Hornstein et al. 2002; Gen- zel et al. 2003; Ghez et al. 2004; Meyer et al. 2014). The NIR emission arises primarily from synchrotron radia- tion very close ( ≲15 Schwarzschild radii) to the event horizon and can be used to bridge the radio and X-ray bands to construct a coherent description of the emission processes in radiatively-inefficient, advection-dominated black hole accretion flows (e.g. Fazio et al. 2018; Witzel et al. 2021). There have been numerous efforts to statistically char- acterize the NIR variability. Do et al. (2009) showed that light curves from 2005-2007 can be described by a red-noise process that is correlated in time and does not exhibit periodicity or quasi-periodicity.

       "  'Dodds-Eden et al. (2011) found the data to be described by a two-state model with a low-level log-normal component and a separate power- law tail for flares. On the other hand, a recent com- prehensive analysis of over 13,000 measurements of Sgr A* flux density with Keck data at 2.12 µm (2003-2014) and VLT and Spitzer data at 4.5 µm (2004-2017) found that the NIR time variability can indeed be consistently described by red noise, but that the entire distribution of fluxes is well-fit by a single log-normal model without a separate flaring component (Witzel et al. 2018). By re-analyzing speckle data from Keck (1995-2005), Chen et al. (2019) extended the time baseline of Sgr A* obser- vations and showed that the statistical model of Witzel et al. (2018) remained consistent with the data over two decades through 2018. However, in May 2019 Do et al. (2019) observed an unprecedented bright NIR event with Keck. The flux of Sgr A* varied by a factor of 75 over a 2-hour timescale and reached twice the level of any previous historical NIR measurement. The maximum fluxes were observed at the beginning of observations, suggesting that Sgr A* was likely even brighter prior to taking measurements that night. With additional bright events observed at Keck in 2019, Do et al. (2019) showed the 2019 activ- ity to be inconsistent with the historical flux distribu- tion of Witzel et al. (2018). Additionally, a high abun- dance of bright NIR events were observed with VLT in 2019 relative to other years (Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020). Heightened activity was also seen in the ra- dio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al. 2022; Cheng et al. 2023) and X-ray regimes (e.g. Pavlinsky 2019; Degenaar et al. 2019). These observations collec- tively suggest that Sgr A* displayed unusual behavior in 2019, making this era useful for understanding the time-variable accretion flow onto the black hole. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the elevated 2019 activity. These possibilities and their ob- servable signatures include the following. 1. The statistical models of Sgr A* in the NIR need to be updated to capture the bright events. While Witzel et al. (2018) found that historical mea- surements follow a single log-normal distribution, Gravity Collaboration et al. (2020) argues that the 2019',\n",

       "  'bright events observed by Keck and VLT are rare events drawn from the power-law tail of the underlying two-state distribution described by Dodds-Eden et al. (2011). In such two-state mod- els, the faint distribution arises from steady accre- tion of mass from the black hole’s environment, and the flaring state arises from a separate pro- cess that injects additional energy. A related ques- tion concerns whether there exists a quasi-steady, quiescent “floor” to the Sgr A* light curves or whether Sgr A* displays similar variability char- acteristics at both faint and high levels (e.g. Do et al. 2009). Previous studies have historically been complicated by short time baselines or have not closely examined the faint end of the flux dis- tribution. We can examine Sgr A* at low flux densities over a long time baseline to determine whether such a quiescent state exists and to study whether the statistical character of the emission at faint flux densities is simply an extension of what we see at higher flux densities. We can also study whether the faint flux densities are different in 2019 than in other years. If the 2019 events are indicative of a power-law “flaring” state dis- tinct from the log-normal “quiescent” state, we should see only the flaring state affected and the faint end of the flux distribution unchanged be- tween 2019 and other years. A shift in the faint end of the flux distribution in 2019 would instead suggest that Sgr A* experienced a physical change during this time. 2. There was a temporary accretion increase onto Sgr A*. The Galactic center hosts a population of stars and dusty G-objects, which could affect the accretion flow. The star S0-2 underwent closest approach in 2018, and its passage may have in- duced an accretion disturbance (Loeb 2004). In the past two decades, the objects G1 and G2 un- derwent closest approach and showed signs of tidal interaction with the black hole, causing much spec- ulation about the potential for excess material from these objects to induce heightened Sgr A* activity (e.g. Gillessen et al. 2012; Phifer et al. 3 2013; Eckart et al. 2013; Witzel et al. 2014; Pfuhl et al. 2015; Witzel et al. 2017; Plewa et al. 2017; Gillessen et al. 2019). While an increase in X-ray flares was reported',\n",

       " ['pdf1.pdf',\n",
       "  'following G2’s passage in 2014 (Ponti et al. 2015), no exceptional NIR activity was reported in the years immediately following 2014. However, it is possible that there is a larger time delay between the passage of G2 and any ob- served NIR activity (e.g Kawashima et al. 2017; Murchikova 2021). If a neighboring source, such as S0-2 or G2, deposited gas or altered the accretion flow onto Sgr A*, we would expect to see height- ened activity for the duration of time it takes that material to fall into the black hole, followed by a return to more typical behavior. 3. Sgr A* has entered a new accretion state in which bright flares are more common, or the 2019 ac- tivity is a precursor to an even larger event (Do et al. 2019). Observations of X-ray light echoes from iron line emission at the Galactic center sug- gest that in the past several hundred years, Sgr A* has undergone multiple ( ∼2-10 year) luminos- ity increases by factors of up to 10 5 (e.g. Ponti et al. 2010; Clavel et al. 2013; Terrier et al. 2018; Chuard et al. 2018). If Sgr A* is undergoing a state change or entering an extreme episode, we should see the activity of Sgr A* continue or evolve in the years beyond 2019. To test these hypotheses, we must compare the be- havior of Sgr A* before, during, and after 2019 at both low and high flux densities. Previous studies used dif- ferent photometric methods (e.g. aperture photometry, point spread function fitting, interferometry) and vary- ing treatments for stellar contamination of Sgr A*, mak- ing the comparison of absolute flux densities unreliable, especially at fainter levels. In this work, we present Sgr A* observations using Keck Observatory from 2005- 2022, all reduced with the same methodology, allowing for a robust comparison of flux densities over time. This study includes re-reduced data from Witzel et al. (2018) and Do et al. (2019), as well as newly presented histor- ical data (2005-2017; Sgr A* is confused by the bright star S0-2 in 2018) and more recent observations taken in 2019 and from 2020-2022.

Keck observations Our observations of the Galactic center were taken with the Keck 2 Telescope using the narrow camera in the Near-Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2) imager with the Laser-Guide Star Adaptive Optics (LGS AO) system (Wizinowich et al. 2006). All of the Keck observations in this work were taken with the K′ filter (2.12 µm). Individual K′ images consist of 10 coadds of 2.8-second integration time each. Standard image reduction meth- ods were applied, including flat-fielding, sky subtraction, and cosmic ray removal via the Keck AO Imaging (KAI) data reduction pipeline (Lu et al. 2021). Photometry was performed on individual images to construct light curves for Sgr A*. We used the point spread function (PSF) fitting program Starfinder to measure the brightness and position of sources (Diolaiti et al. 2000). Using the same procedure as in Do et al. (2019), a different PSF was constructed for each image to account for changes in effective PSF due to seeing variations. To increase the number of Sgr A* detec- tions at faint flux levels, we used an enhanced version of Starfinder that includes a priori knowledge of the location of Sgr A* and other nearby NIR sources (Horn- stein et al. 2007). For each epoch, the source locations in a nightly-averaged image were used as fixed inputs into Starfinder to more accurately fit for Sgr A* and neighboring sources in the individual frames. Our photometric calibration has been updated since Do et al. (2019), making the observed flux densities of all sources within the central arcsecond of the Galactic center (including Sgr A*) systematically lower by∼10%. Photometric uncertainties were estimated by fitting a power law between the flux and RMS flux uncertainty for stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*, as described in Do et al. (2009). We then used this relationship to calculate the uncertainty in flux for Sgr A*. More details about our photometric calibration and uncertainty estimations can be found in Appendix A. The photometric stability of our observations is discussed in Appendix B. In this study, we work with observed flux densities (rather than dereddened) to make our results compara- ble to Do et al. (2019). We',\n",

Dereddened fluxes can be computed using Fdereddened = Fobs × 100.4AKs . Different studies have used different extinction values, such as AKs = 2 .46 (Sch¨ odel et al. 2010), AKs = 2 .8 (Genzel et al. 2003; Eckart et al. 2006), AKs = 3 .2 (Hornstein et al. 2007), and AKs = 3.3 (Do et al. 2009). As in Do et al. (2019), we will occasionally aid readers by presenting both observed and dereddened flux densities computed using AKs = 2.46. 4 2.2. Sample selection We introduce several selection criteria to make our Keck data set more robust for comparing Sgr A* vari- ability over time. Beginning with 104 Galactic center observation epochs from 2005-2022, we apply the fol- lowing successive cuts to our sample: 1. Considering only observing epochs in which 20 or more quality (Strehl ratio >0.2) images of the Galactic center were taken. Below 20 frames, the light curves are poorly sampled for timing analy- ses. 18 such epochs are removed from our sample. 2. Removing epochs in which our PSF reference stars are saturated. Saturated PSF reference stars in- troduce a photometric bias that makes our Sgr A* flux measurements unreliable. 3 such epochs are removed from our sample. 3. Removing epochs in which the bright star S0-2 (K = 14.2 mag) is confused with Sgr A* (in late 2017 and 2018). Attempting to correct for S0-2’s flux bias introduces large uncertainties that are compa- rable to faint Sgr A* flux levels. 14 such epochs are removed, leaving 69 observation epochs for con- sideration. For epochs in which a fainter S-star is confused with Sgr A*, we apply a photometric correction (see Appendix H for procedure). 4. Considering only images with Strehl ratio greater than 0.2 within each of the 69 remaining nights. At lower Strehl ratios, the photometry is unreliable due to poor seeing conditions. About 10% of 7935 frames have Strehl ratios below 0.2, leaving 7155 frames that survive our data quality cut. The 69 observation epochs that we have selected for our sample are described in Table 1. The epochs that we have chosen to exclude and justifications for omission are found in Appendix C.',\n",

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 3.1. Significantly different flux distribution in 2019 6 The flux distributions of Sgr A* reveal that flux densi- ties in 2019 were elevated at both faint and bright levels, and that the post-2019 activity of Sgr A* is statistically consistent with the pre-2019 activity. We construct his- tograms of the light curves and present the flux distribu- tions for the pre-2019 (2005-2017), 2019, and post-2019 (2020-2022) epochs in Figure 1. In our sample, Sgr A* is detected ∼93% of the time. Our treatment of non- detections is discussed in Appendix E. As shown in Do et al. (2019), the 2019 distribution has a tail extending to high flux densities that is not present before 2019. Our post-2019 results show no such extended tail, indicating that we have seen no high flux densities at 2019 levels in more recent years. We observe that the shapes of the pre- and post-2019 distributions appear to be',\n",

       " ['pdf1.pdf',\n",
       "  'quite similar, whereas the 2019 distribution appears skewed to higher flux densities. We are also able to measure the long-term median of the flux distribution, enabled by our consistent re- duction methodology with photometric corrections for stellar confusion. We find that the median of the 2019 distribution is 0.20 mJy (1.9 mJy dereddened), which doubles the 0.10 mJy (1.0 mJy dereddened) medians of the pre- and post-2019 distributions. Other percentiles of the flux distribution are presented in Table 2. We observe that in addition to the median, the flux levels of 2019 are elevated at all percentiles compared to the pre- ceding and succeeding distributions, demonstrating that the 2019 behavior was indeed unusual beyond merely the extremely bright event of 2019-05-13. On the other hand, nearly all percentiles are similar between the pre- and post-2019 distributions. The exception is at the high flux end, where discrepancies between the pre- and post-2019 distributions are explained by a recent lack of bright flux excursions. Furthermore, by adding our flux distributions and dividing by the number of observations within each time period, we can compare the average lu- minosity of Sgr A* at 2.12 µm. We find that Sgr A* was on average ∼3 times more luminous at this wavelength in 2019 than in the pre-2019 observations. Since 2019, Sgr A* has had an average luminosity of ∼0.9 times its pre-2019 luminosity. We can use two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to quantitatively compare our flux distributions. We note that KS-tests assume independent measurements and Sgr A* light curves are time-correlated on an intra- night basis; however, as in Do et al. (2019), we can compare flux distributions with multiple nights of ob- servations that are uncorrelated with one another to roughly compare the general behavior of Sgr A* over long time periods. We use the inferred flux distributions (described in Appendix E) to mitigate the bias induced by non-detections. Performing a KS-test between our pre-2019 and 2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of 0.39 ( p ≪ 1), showing it is highly unlikely that these data sets come from the same underlying distribution. Do et al. (2019) also used a KS-test and found a large disagreement between the 2019 sample and historical data. Performing a KS-test between our 2019 and post- 2019 distributions yields a KS-statistic of 0.36 (',\n",

On the other hand, performing a KS-test between our pre-2019 and post-2019 distributions yields a much lower KS-statistic of 0.04 (p ∼ 0.03), showing these distributions are more similar. If we restrict our KS-test to flux densities above 0.05 mJy (where non-detections become negligible), we find a comparable KS-statistic of 0.05 (p ∼ 0.01). Based on these results, we find that the pre-2019 and post-2019 flux distributions of Sgr A* agree at the ∼2σ level. Figure 1. Measured flux distributions of Sgr A* scaled to com- pare peaks and shapes of the pre-2019 (blue), 2019 (black), and post-2019 (orange) distributions, with dashed lines showing the distribution medians. We find that the 2019 flux distribution is elevated with respect to the pre- and post-2019 distributions. In addition to consistency between the pre-2019 and post-2019 flux distributions, we find that the post-2019 data agree with model predictions. As in Do et al. (2019), we compare the observations to the model 3 of Witzel et al. (2018), which is a log-normally dis- tributed red noise process. This model was informed by over 13,000 infrared measurements from Keck, VLT, and Spitzer and importantly accounts for the temporal correlations of Sgr A*’s flux with time. For each of our three samples (pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019), we draw 10,000 parameter combinations from the posterior and for each parameter combination, generate a single light curve with the time sampling of the nights in the respec- tive sample (45 nights for pre-2019, 6 nights for 2019, 7 Table 2.Flux distribution percentiles Percentile Pre-2019 flux 2019 flux Post-2019 flux (mJy) (mJy) (mJy) 5% 0.01 0.03 0.03 14% 0.03 0.06 0.04 25% 0.05 0.13 0.05 50% 0.10 0.20 0.10 75% 0.17 0.41 0.18 86% 0.26 0.55 0.23 95% 0.47 1.68 0.40 and 18 nights for post-2019).

Consistent with the expectation that our historical sample should agree with the established model, our pre-2019 observations match the historical model at the 1-2σ level. We find that',\n",

Of most interest to this study is the behavior of Sgr A* in the years since 2019. We find that the post-2019 observations fall within the predictions of the historical model. The lack of high fluxes in more recent years does place these observations below model predictions at the ∼2.5σ level (for fluxes reaching ∼0.6 mJy, i.e. all the data except the two brightest events) and at the ∼1.5σ level for the highest measured flux densities. While ad- ditional observations in coming years may reveal a more statistically significant lack of activity, our current re- sults demonstrate that the recent observations are con- sistent with historical expectations at the∼2σ level. Sgr A* has displayed statistically typical, albeit diminished levels of activity. 3.1.1. Impact of the brightest night on the flux distribution We examine the impact that the night with the bright- est event (2019-05-13) has on our results by constructing the 2019 flux distribution without this night. This in- vestigation is motivated by the possibility of 2019 being an otherwise ordinary era with a single rare event that biases the flux distribution to higher levels. The flux dis- tribution and percentiles with this night removed can be found in Appendix F. We find that the removal of this night certainly impacts the high end of the flux distri- bution, but the median of the distribution remains the same and the peak of the distribution remains shifted to higher flux levels with respect to the historical distribu- tion. Although the other nights in 2019 individually do Figure 2.

The parameters to generate the simulated light curves were drawn from the log-normal, red-noise posterior of Witzel et al. (2018). These simulations show that while the 2019 data are inconsistent with model predictions at the >3σ level, the pre- and post-2019 activity generally agrees with the model at the 1-2σ level. We note that our',\n",

A KS-test between the pre-2019 distribution and the 2019 distribu- tion without the brightest night yields a KS-statistic of 0.42 (p ≪ 1), reinforcing that these data sets are highly dissimilar. As such, we conclude that our finding that the 2019 flux distribution is significantly different is ro- bust whether or not the brightest night is included. The inclusion of this night only bolsters the result. 3.2. Bright events in the NIR Sgr A* light curve The light curve of Sgr A* over 17 years shows the heightened flux densities in 2019 and relative lack of ac- tivity in the following years (see Figure 3). To construct this light curve, we stitch together the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 data and remove time gaps between ob- servation epochs. Individual light curves from each of these three subsets displaying both bright and faint flux densities are shown in Appendix G. We find no bright fluxes in the post-2019 data at the level of the two brightest events in 2019. In six nights of 2019 observations, the two brightest events have maxi- mum flux densities of 5.58± 0.04 mJy (corresponding to 53.8 mJy dereddened) and 1.56 ± 0.03 mJy (15.0 mJy dereddened). In seven nights of observations in 2020 and 2021, the highest flux density measured is only 0.60 ± 0.04 mJy (5.8 mJy dereddened). In 11 observation epochs in 2022, we observed only two bright flux excur- sions with maximum flux densities of 0.74 ± 0.06 mJy (7.1 mJy dereddened) and 0.93 ± 0.03 mJy (9.0 mJy dereddened). Neither of these are comparable to the 2019 events. There is also a lack of bright flux excursions in the post-2019 data as compared to the pre-2019 data. We observe four events in the pre-2019 data (counting two on 2010-05-05) with flux densities greater than 1 mJy and no flux densities at this level post-2019. Six events with flux densities greater than 0.8 mJy are observed in the pre-2019 data, and only one is observed post-2019. The post-2019 sample is only ∼43% as long as the pre- 2019 sample, but there remains a',\n",

Sgr A* has no quiescent state in the NIR Our new methodology allows for measurements of faint flux densities in the NIR over 17 years and the abil- ity to search for a quiescent, quasi-steady state. Such a state would present itself as a “floor” to the Sgr A* light curve. This study is the first to examine faint Sgr A* flux densities from 2005-2022 while making corrections for stellar confusion, allowing for reliable comparisons of faint Sgr A* flux densities over a long time baseline to search for such a floor. We find that there is no quasi-steady floor to the NIR Sgr A* light curve at faint flux densities. When viewed in linear flux space (such as the upper light curve in Fig- ure 3), Sgr A* does appear to spend most of its time in a faint state that is punctuated by bright “flares”. How- ever, the data show that Sgr A* has been highly variable even at low flux densities over 17 years. By examining the light curve in logarithmic flux density space (bottom light curve in Figure 3), we see that Sgr A* shows no qui- escent state in the NIR and instead displays stochastic variability over a factor of ∼500 in flux. Flux densities do not level off at some faint value, but are continuously and significantly variable down to about 0.01 mJy (0.1 mJy dereddened), which is the limit where we are able to detect Sgr A* with >1σ confidence and which only a small fraction of frames likely fall below. 3.4. Timing characteristics of the light curves We can use the first order structure function to exam- ine the timing characteristics of the NIR light curves, as is often done in timing analyses for both Sgr A* and extragalactic AGN (e.g. Simonetti et al. 1985; Hughes et al. 1992; Do et al. 2009). The structure function ulti- mately allows one to determine the power spectral den- sity (PSD) slope for a set of unevenly sampled data. For a light curve with flux measurementsF(t) at times t, the first order structure function V (τ) is defined as V (τ) ≡ ⟨[F(t + τ) − F(t)]2⟩. (1) We bin the time lags τ and distribute the V (τ)',\n",

The aver- age of V (τ) values within each bin is used as the struc- ture function value for that bin. The error associated with each bin is σbin/√Nbin, where σbin is the standard deviation of V (τ) values within that bin and Nbin is the number of values in the bin. The structure functions for the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 light curves are presented in Figure 4. The logarithmic slope of the structure function β (where V (τ) ∝ τβ) can be related to the power law index α of the PSD (P ∝ f−α) for each of the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 samples. To make the conversion from measured measured β to α, we generate 103 light curves with the respective time sampling and fixed PSD slope α, then measure the structure function slope β. This procedure is repeated for varying values of α between α = 1.5 and α = 3.0. We perform a linear fit between α and β (see Appendix I), then use this linear fit to convert the structure function slopes we measure in the real data to PSD slopes. The measured values of β and α for the 9 Figure 3.Light curve of Sgr A* containing all observations in this study with time gaps between epochs removed, displayed in linear space (top) and logarithmic space (bottom).

The structure function slope β is measured in the regime where the structure function is approximately linear (5-40 minutes) to avoid artifacts from three-minute dithering and increased white noise in the observations at short time lags. However, we do factor a systematic uncertainty into our reported α and β measurements computed from the standard deviation of structure function fits in several time intervals (1-40 minutes, 3-40 minutes, 5-40 minutes,',\n",

We see that the structure functions have PSD slopes of α ≈ 2-3, consistent with previous findings (e.g. Do et al. 2009) that Sgr A* displays red-noise, power-law behav- ior with higher variability at longer time lags. We find a steeper α for 2019 and a shallower α for the post-2019 data. However, it is worth noting that a more signifi- cant white noise component from stellar contamination in 2020-2022 could cause us to measure a shallower slope for these years (see Appendix I).

On the other hand, the post-2019 structure function falls below the others at all time lags, 10 Table 3.PSD fits from the structure function, where the structure function V (τ) ∝ τβ and the PSD P ∝ f−α Observation Years β α 2005-2017 0.99 ± 0.08 2.35 ± 0.14 2019 1.49 ± 0.17 2.74 ± 0.30 2020-2022 1.03 ± 0.15 2.20 ± 0.19 indicating lower variance at every time lag. Our struc- ture functions reveal that greater average luminosity in 2019 correlates with more extreme variability, and the lower average luminosity post-2019 correlates with rela- tively diminished variability. 4. DISCUSSION Our results show that the 2019 flux distribution was shifted to higher levels and had larger variance. In 2020- 2022, the behavior of Sgr A* was statistically similar, but slightly diminished compared to that of 2005-2017. We also find that Sgr A* has no quiescent state over 17 years of NIR observations. These findings have implica- tions for understanding the time-variable accretion flow onto Sgr A*. The pronounced shift in the 2019 median flux density suggests that Sgr A* experienced a heightened accretion rate, revealing that the 2019 NIR activity was extraor- dinary beyond just the bright events. Gravity Collabo- ration et al. (2020) also reported an elevated median in 2019 (compared to the years 2017 and 2018), although it was found not statistically',\n",

       "  'significant given the num- ber of observations over a time baseline of 3 years. Our time baseline of 17 years provides stronger evidence for a shift in the median of the flux distribution in 2019. The two-state model for the flux distribution with a log- normal quiescent state and power-law tail (Dodds-Eden et al. 2011; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020) interprets bright flares as manifestations of such a tail, but does not account for the changes to the faint emission that we observe in 2019 in this study. Because we see elevated activity at both low and high levels in 2019, explana- tions invoking a physical change to Sgr A*’s accretion state are favored over a new statistical model. Multi-wavelength observations of Sgr A* in 2019 also favor a physical change to the accretion flow. The tem- poral concentration of high fluxes observed in 2019 by Keck and VLT in the NIR, as well as heightened activ- ity in radio (e.g. Murchikova & Witzel 2021; Boyce et al. 2022; Cheng et al. 2023) and X-rays (e.g. Pavlinsky 2019; Degenaar et al. 2019) is also evidence for a physical dis- turbance during 2019. If Sgr A*’s variability were bet- ter characterized by a different underlying distribution than that of Witzel et al. (2018) (a single stochastic pro- cess with a log-normal distribution), we would expect to see bright events and elevated multi-wavelength activity more evenly distributed over two decades, rather than clustered together in a single year. Our results favor models in which extra gas was de- posited onto the black hole in 2019, temporarily increas- ing the accretion rate and stimulating the production of frequent bright events. Such models include a distur- bance induced by the closest approach of the star S0-2 in 2018 or the delayed infall of gas pulled from a tidal in- teraction with the dusty object G2 in 2014. Kawashima et al. (2017) predicted a time-delayed radio and infrared brightening of Sgr A* around 2020 caused by the pas- sage of G2. In their simulations, the magnetic energy within the accretion disk increases by a factor of 3-4 af- ter ∼5 years following the passage of G2. Murchikova (2021) calculates that the infall time of material from G2 (and the possible simultaneous infall of material from the object G1) more',\n",

       "  'closely matches the time delay be- tween pericenter passage and flaring time than that of S0-2. Hydrodynamic simulations have also shown that winds from the passage of S0-2 are unlikely to have a measurable effect on the inner accretion flow (Ressler et al. 2018). If the 2019 activity was indeed caused by a temporary accretion increase, these findings collectively favor the G2 hypothesis over the S0-2 hypothesis as a source for the excess material. We rule out a long-term elevated accretion state, as the variability of Sgr A* resembles its past activity and no extraordinarily bright events have been observed in more recent years. In fact, we have noted a slight lowering of the post-2019 flux distribution at the high end, although this effect is not statistically significant. Numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations have revealed that bright flares powered by magnetic reconnection can eject part of the accretion disk and suppress the mass accretion rate onto the black hole (Ripperda et al. 2022). Changes to the magnetic flux content of the disk in simulations have measurable effects on the light curves and flux distri- butions of Sgr A* (Chatterjee et al. 2021). The lack of high flux densities post-2019 and the slight decrease in mean luminosity could imply that the 2019 activity altered the accretion flow onto Sgr A* for an extended period of time. With more observations, we will be able 11 to determine whether the relative inactivity of Sgr A* in more recent years is in fact statistically significant. A major challenge to precision measurement of the flux distribution of Sgr A* is stellar confusion. Recent observations with NIR interferometry (e.g. Gravity Col- laboration et al. 2020) have improved angular resolution and reduced the impact of confusion on flux measure- ments, but such observations of Sgr A* have only be- gun in 2017. Single-telescope data is complementary to interferometric data because it offers a long time base- line to compare the behavior of Sgr A* across decades, but as in this work, care must be taken to account for confusion. Future work to combine single-telescope and interferometric data sets would help reduce systematics in the study of Sgr A* variability. 5. CONCLUSION Each hypothesis for the 2019 activity of Sgr A* is scientifically plausible for understanding the activity in terms of',\n",

If we are able to trace the activity to S0-2 or G2, we will directly connect the supermassive black hole’s feed- ing behavior to an object in its vicinity and learn more about how neighboring objects supply material for the black hole to accrete. If Sgr A* has undergone a change of state, we will catch a real-time glimpse into the phys- ical response of a supermassive black hole accretion flow to an increase in gas flow. In any case, it is important to determine whether the 2019 activity is representative of Sgr A*’s typical behavior or a period of extraordinary activity. If the former, the 2019 activity should be in- cluded in long-term models of Sgr A*. If the latter, the unusual behavior should be treated as a separate period with distinct physical characteristics. To investigate the origin of the 2019 activity, we have done the following: • Performed a consistent reduction of Keck Sgr A* observations from 2005-2022 with new treatment for stellar confusion to enable a robust comparison of flux densities over nearly two decades • Demonstrated that both faint and bright 2019 flux densities were significantly elevated with respect to pre- and post-2019 observations • Shown that the average luminosity of Sgr A* was ∼3 times higher than historical measurements in 2019 and ∼0.9 times historical measurements in the years 2020-2022 • Shown that while the post-2019 observations are statistically consistent with the historical sample, as well as with the statistical model of Witzel et al. (2018), we have observed a relative deficiency in activity in 2020-2022 at the ∼2σ level • Demonstrated that 2019 showed heightened vari- ability with respect to the years before and after, indicating that a greater average luminosity seems correlated with more extreme variability • Found no evidence for a NIR quiescent state of Sgr A*; Sgr A* displays stochastic flux variations over a factor of ∼500 and is continuously variable down to about 0.01 mJy We argue that the observed increase in NIR flux den- sities in 2019, along with the concentration of bright events measured by many observatories that year, points to a transient increase in accretion activity during 2019. In these models, excess gas is temporarily deposited onto the black hole from the closest',\n",

Numerical simulations and analytic calculations have favored the black hole’s tidal interac- tion with G2 in 2014 as a source for this excess material. Further modeling of G-object interactions with the ac- cretion flow and their ability to cause the 2019 activity should be done to provide a more robust comparison to observations. We have ruled out the hypothesis that 2019 is a pre- cursor to a long-term elevated accretion state, as the current behavior of Sgr A* resembles its behavior be- fore 2019, and we have seen a lack of high fluxes in more recent years. Future NIR observations will continue to monitor the black hole for signs of increased (or de- creased) activity. Further analyses of multi-wavelength data will help us compare the physical mechanisms be- hind the bright events of 2019 and other years. We thank the anonymous referee for their helpful com- ments.

The magnitude difference between the previous and new photometric calibrations for sources in the central 10 arcseconds is 0.093±0.003 and in the central 1 arsecond in 0.096±0.003, with stars being systematically fainter in the new calibration (see Figure 5). In this work, we used the following calibrator stars: IRS 16NW, S3-22, S1-17, S1-34, S4-3, S1-1, S1-21, S3-370, S3-88, S3-36, and S2-63. We derived reference flux measurements for the selected calibrator stars using the Sch¨ odel et al. (2010) photometric catalog transformed to the Keck NIRC2 bandpasses. The procedure to transform fluxes from VLT NACO Ks and H-bands to Keck NIRC2 K′ and H-bands is described in more detail in Gautam et al. (2019). More details of our new photometric calibration are forthcoming in Gautam et al. in prep. Photometric uncertainties were estimated by fitting a power law between the flux level and RMS flux uncertainty for stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*, as described in Do et al. (2009). We then used this relationship to calculate the uncertainty in flux measurements for Sgr A*. The photometric uncertainties are generally less than 15% for low flux values ( ≲0.2 mJy) and less than 5% for high flux values ( ≳0.2 mJy). Sample power law fits to determine flux measurement uncertainties are shown in Figure 6. The flux uncertainties for central arcsecond sources are not significantly different between the previous and new photometric calibrations. Figure 5. Comparison of observed magnitudes for Galactic center sources between the photometric calibration of Do et al. (2019) and the new calibration in this work (Gautam et al. in prep.), as a function of magnitude in the new calibration. We see that sources are systematically fainter by about 10% with the new calibration. B. PHOTOMETRIC STABILITY We investigate the photometric stability of our observations by constructing flux distributions for two comparison stars, S1-1 and S1-33, that are known to not be variable and span nearly an order of magnitude in flux (Gautam et al. in prep). The pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 flux distributions of these stars and the nightly mean and standard deviation of the fluxes are presented in Figure 7.',\n",

       "  'We find that the differences between the means and standard deviations of the flux distributions of these stars is not significant between the pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 eras. The total 2005-2022 flux distribution for S1-1 can be described by a Gaussian with a width of ∼3%, and that of S1-33 can be described by a Gaussian with a width of ∼5%. The scatter of mean flux levels between individual nights for S1-1 is ∼2% and for S1-33 is ∼4%. Within individual nights, the average scatter is ∼1% for S1-1 and ∼3% for S1-33. As such, between all of our observations we are able to consistently reproduce the fluxes of S1-1 and S1-33 at the level of a few percent. The fluctuations in flux density for these non-variable stars are much smaller than the variations in Sgr A* flux density that we find, indicating that the shifts in the Sgr A* flux distributions that we report are photometrically robust. C. OBSERVATION EPOCHS OMITTED In Section 2.2, we describe the successive cuts made to our sample to ensure robust photometry and comparisons of Sgr A* activity over time. Out of the 104 Galactic center K′ observing epochs taken with Keck from 2005-2022, the 35 that we have omitted from our analysis are given in Table 4, along with the reasons for omission. 15 Figure 6. Sample power law fits to the RMS fluxes for stars within 1 arcsecond of Sgr A* within the typical Sgr A* flux range. Shown here are the fits for three observing epochs (2010-05-05, 2019-05-13, 2022-05-21). We perform this procedure for each of the 69 nights in our sample and use the respective power law fits to determine the uncertainties on the Sgr A* flux measurements. Figure 7.

LIGHT CURVE DATA We present the 2005-2022 light curve data of Sgr A* in Table 5, which is used to construct the light curve shown in Figure 3 and the flux distributions. The Table 5 data are presented as observed in the K′-band without corrections for extinction and before applying the photometric corrections for stellar confusion given in Table 9. E. NON-DETECTIONS OF SGR A* In the data, Sgr A* is detected ∼93% of the time, indicating that the flux distribution is mostly unbiased. However, because the flux of Sgr A* does not vary significantly between consecutive frames, we can estimate the values of non-detected fluxes based on the lowest neighboring flux measurement in the light curves. Comparisons between the measured and inferred flux distributions are shown in Figure 8. We find that Sgr A* is detected >99% of the time above FKs = 0.05 mJy. ∼26% of frames in the pre-2019 distribution, ∼12% of frames in the 2019 distribution, and 17 Table 5.Sgr A* light curve data Observation Date Time Flux Flux Error Mag Mag Error (YYYY-MM-DD) (UT) (mJy) (mJy) ( K′) ( K′) 2005-07-31 06:59:49.52 0.180 0.017 16.451 0.105 2005-07-31 07:03:19.17 0.158 0.016 16.592 0.112 2005-07-31 07:06:54.02 0.182 0.017 16.441 0.104 2005-07-31 07:10:15.68 0.165 0.017 16.550 0.110 2005-07-31 07:13:43.73 0.141 0.015 16.717 0.119 ... 2022-08-20 07:25:55.18 0.281 0.020 15.970 0.078 2022-08-20 07:31:20.56 0.250 0.019 16.094 0.082 2022-08-20 07:32:20.23',\n",

Table 5 is published electronically in its entirety in a machine-readable format in the online journal. A portion is shown here for guidance regarding its form and content. Missing flux and magnitude values in the full table correspond to non-detections of Sgr A*. ∼24% of frames in the post-2019 distribution fall below this threshold. As such, while we estimate flux distribution percentiles using the inferred flux distributions, the median (50th percentile) values we present are not biased by the non-detections. We do not impute values for non-detections in our timing analyses, as this procedure would artificially introduce noise. Figure 8. Measured and inferred flux distributions for the pre-2019 (left), 2019 (middle), and post-2019 (right) epochs. The values of non-detections in the inferred distributions are estimated from neighboring flux measurements in the light curves. F. 2019 FLUX DISTRIBUTION WITH BRIGHTEST NIGHT REMOVED In Section 3.1.1, we discuss how removing the night with the highest flux densities (2019-05-13) impacts our analysis of the flux distribution. Figure 9 shows the 2019 flux distribution without the brightest night, and Table 6 shows the percentiles of the flux distribution. G. INDIVIDUAL LIGHT CURVES We present some individual light curves from pre-2019, 2019, and post-2019 observing epochs to demonstrate the range of variability that Sgr A* exhibits. Figure 10 shows some of the brightest measured flux densities and Figure 11 contains light curves displaying relatively low activity. H. STELLAR CONFUSION CORRECTION The Galactic center is a crowded field with stars occasionally confusing Sgr A* on the sky, so we must consider how extended PSFs from nearby stellar sources contaminate the measured Sgr A* flux. Previous studies (e.g. Witzel et al. 18 Figure 9.Flux distributions of Sgr A* scaled to compare peaks and shapes of the pre-2019 distribution (blue), 2019 distribution (black), and 2019 distribution with the brightest night removed (gold), with dashed lines showing the distribution medians. Although removing the brightest night lowers the high flux end of the 2019 distribution, the peak of the 2019 distribution remains elevated with respect to the historical distribution, and the 2019 median is unchanged.

This procedure makes all the data comparable, but deletes information about potential shifts in the median flux density caused by changes in the accretion rate. In this study, we seek to measure the shift in the median of the flux distribution between 2019 and other years to examine the accretion flow, so we take a new approach to characterizing confusion. To correct for the flux bias attributed to Sgr A* for epochs when a known star is within the confusion limit, we subtract a value informed from simulations of stellar confusion with Sgr A*. We injected synthetic stars near Sgr A* in a series of five unconfused images from 2014-05-19 with characteristic data quality (Strehl ratio ∼0.27) and median Sgr A* flux levels (∼0.1 mJy), noting that our results are relatively insensitive to these choices within the uncertainties. In each set of images, we planted stars at distances from 0-100 mas (randomly oriented) and K′ brightnesses from 14-18 mag, then ran Starfinder on the simulated images. See Figure 12 for sample images from our injection procedure. By subtracting out the known unconfused flux of Sgr A* from our detected value, we are able to obtain an estimate for the photometric bias induced by the stellar injections. The results of this procedure can be found in Table 7. We also measure the position of Sgr A* and report the astrometric biases in Table 8. For injections below 60 mas, the source and Sgr A* are almost always detected as a combined source, making the confusion correction reliable. However, from ∼60-80 mas, Sgr A* and the injected star are sometimes detected together, individually, or not at all–with varying flux densities in each case. While no confusion corrections for 60-80 mas were needed in this study, future studies should treat this range with care by determining whether Starfinder is detecting Sgr A* and the confused star separately or together.

For the observation epochs affected by stellar confusion, we determined the distance of the confusing star from Sgr A* by performing an orbital fit to aligned images of the Galactic center and obtaining the predicted distance at the 19 Figure 10.

The brightest event from 18 nights of post-2019 observations is shown on the right (2022-05-21), reaching ∼0.9 mJy. epoch observation time (O’Neil et al. in prep). Given the brightness of the star and its distance, we interpolated the star-planting results in Table 7 to obtain the flux bias to subtract from the data. The epoch-wise corrections we applied are given in Table 9, and the flux distributions of affected data before and after correction are shown in Figure 13. This procedure overcorrects and yields negative flux values in only a small percentage of frames. The corrections slightly increase the photometric uncertainties to ∼20% for low fluxes, and high flux uncertainties are typically less than 5%. In this work, we have excluded epochs in which the bright star S0-2 falls within 60 mas of Sgr A* (July 2017-2018), as the uncertainties on S0-2’s flux bias correction are comparable to faint Sgr A* flux levels. Starfinder reliably detects S0-2 and Sgr A* as distinct sources in the remaining data. There is likely an unresolved stellar component that contributes to the measured flux densities, but we are unable to disentangle this effect from temporal variations of the Sgr A* baseline flux in this',\n",

STRUCTURE FUNCTION ANALYSIS To convert between the structure function slope β and PSD slope α, we generate 103 light curves with the respective time sampling and fixed PSD slope α, then measure the structure function slope β. This procedure is repeated for 20 Figure 11. Sample of faint Ks light curves of Sgr A*. Dashed lines show the 95th and 50th percentile flux values from the historical distribution. Comparing to Figure 10, we see that Sgr A* displays a range of variability at both low and high levels. Top row: Faint pre-2019 light curves. Middle row: Faint 2019 light curves.

See Figure 14 for the relationships between α and β that we find from the simulations. We perform a linear fit to these values to make the conversion between structure function slope and PSD slope in the data. In Table 3, we found a shallower PSD slope for the 2020-2022 data compared to the pre-2019 and 2019 data. To determine whether a greater white noise component in the post-2019 data is responsible for this shallower slope, we simulate 103 light curves with the post-2019 time sampling assuming an intrisic PSD slope ofα = 2.5, then add varying levels of white noise and fit for a measured value of α (a procedure performed in Do et al. 2019). We find in Figure 15 that as the ratio of white noise to red noise becomes ≲10, a flatter PSD slope is indeed measured. As a result, the white noise contamination from the stars S0-61 in 2021 and S0-38 in 2022 could have caused a shallower value of α to be measured for these years. 21 Figure 12.

We then ran our PSF fitting program Starfinder on each image to determine the photometric bias in our measurement of Sgr A*’s flux. This procedure was repeated for five similar frames and the average values of the photometric bias induced by the injected stars are displayed at the bottom of each image. As a general trend, the photometric bias decreases with increasing distance.

Corrections are subtracted from the K′ observed flux densities. 25 Figure 13. Flux distributions before and after confusion corrections for epochs affected by stellar confusion. From 2005-2009 (blue), we make corrections for S0-104 and S0-102. In 2021-2022 (orange), we make corrections for S0-61 and S0-38. We see that the distributions are shifted to lower flux densities upon removal of the photometric bias. Despite reflecting different epochs that are affected by confusion from different stars, these two corrected flux distributions appear to be quite similar.
