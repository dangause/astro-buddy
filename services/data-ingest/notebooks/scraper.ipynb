Theoretical studies indeed suggest\\nthat the distribution of gas and metals surrounding galaxies is in-\\ntricately linked to processes such as gas accretion, galactic winds,\\nmergers, and stripping that dictate galactic evolution (e.g., Rahmati\\net al. 2016; van de Voort et al. 2019; Oppenheimer et al. 2020;\\nAppleby et al. 2022; Mitchell & Schaye 2022). It is thus crucial to\\nmap the distributions of diffuse matter surrounding galaxies with a\\nrange of galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass ( 𝑀∗), star formation\\nrate (SFR), specific-SFR (sSFR)) to gain insight into such physical\\nprocesses.\\nThe semi-empirical relation between the stellar mass to halo\\nmass ratio ( 𝑀∗/𝑀halo) as a function of 𝑀haloshows a peak at\\n𝑀halo≈1012M⊙, suggesting that these halos are most efficient\\nin converting baryons into stars (e.g., Conroy et al. 2006; Behroozi\\net al. 2013, 2019). It is not well understood why halos of a certain\\nmass have higher star formation efficiencies (SFE). Energy and mo-\\nmentumfeedbackduetosupernovae(SNe)andactivegalacticnuclei\\n(AGN) is thought to suppress the SFE for the low-mass and high-\\nmass halos, respectively (see e.g., Bower et al. 2006; Somerville\\n©2023 The AuthorsarXiv:2303.16933v2  [astro-ph.GA]  25 Jan 2024\\n2 S. Dutta et al.\\net al. 2008; Crain et al. 2015) . Theoretical models suggest two dis-\\ntinct modes of gas accretion depending on the halo mass: (a) “hot\\nmode” for galaxies with 𝑀halo>1012M⊙and (b) “cold mode” for\\ngalaxies with 𝑀halo<1012M⊙(see e.g., Kereš et al. 2005; van de\\nVoort et al. 2011).
